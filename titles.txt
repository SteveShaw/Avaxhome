This course introduces the academic approach of Sustainability and explores how today’s human societies can endure in the face of global change, ecosystem degradation and resource limitations. The course focuses on key knowledge areas of sustainability theory and practice, including population, ecosystems, global change, energy, agriculture, water, environmental economics and policy, ethics, and cultural history.
This subject is of vital importance, seeking as it does to uncover the principles of the long-term welfare of all the peoples of the planet. As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).

Syllabus

Orientation and Introduction
In this module, you will become familiar with the course, your classmates, and the learning environment. The orientation also helps you obtain the technical skills required for the course. In the introduction, we will examine some of the central ideas that underpin the Earth as a system, and their consequences for environmental sustainability.

Population
In this module, we will see how human populations have evolved over time and get a sense of where the next century of change will take us. 

Ecosystems and Climate Change
In this module, we will see that the Earth faces many environmental pressures that result from human exploitation of natural resources. We will also look at the issue of climate change. 

Energy
In this module, we will look at energy use. We will also consider what the trend of energy use means for the planet, and how we might transition to a more sustainable pattern of use. 

Water and Agriculture
In this module, we will explore the connection between water and food, and see what will be required to feed the planet over the course of the century. 

Environmental Policy
In this module, we will examine some of the common tools used by policy-makers, and some of the forces that shape (or misshape) policy. 

Measuring Sustainability
In this module, we will examine what tools are available to measure sustainability. Finally, I will make some predictions on global sustainability for the 21st century, based on the models we have spoken about in this course and the trends that have been observed in the early part of this century.

Conclusion
Welcome to the end of the course! This module has a final, comprehensive quiz that covers all of the topics that we’ve seen in the previous seven modules. You’ll want to be familiar with the goals and objectives, key phrases, concepts, and guiding questions from the earlier modules to do well on this final quiz.

The suggested 8 week schedule is balanced between Strength/Sculpting exercises, Aerobic exercises and stretching. It is given here as a guide line that will show you how you can best progress from one week to the next.

Customize

You can also customize your own workout plan by adding or subtracting specific workouts from the program to help you meet your own individual fitness goals. The program also includes a warm up and a cool down that you should incorporate into starting off and ending any of the other workouts.

The program is designed to give you the flexibility to chose between the 10 minute workouts individually, or between working out to each DVD from beginning to end, for 2 full and thorough 60 minute workouts per DVD!"

Build your RESTful Web Service with ASP.NET Web API 2 from the ground up and learn how to use the new Attribute Routing.

In this course you will learn how to build a RESTful web service with ASP.NET Web API 2 and integrate it into an ASP.NET web application. You will use Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, which is completely free. Whether you are new to web services or already have built a web service with the first release of Web API or any other framework doesn't matter, you will build your new service from the ground up. What you already should have is a little experience in C#. Having some knowledge in JQuery and building web applications in general might help, but is not absolutely necessary.

By the end of this course, you will be able to build a RESTful web service with Web API 2 by yourself, make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP Requests with JQuery and AJAX and use the new Attribute Routing of Web API 2 to control your REST web service design by creating custom URIs. You will also get a sneak peak at Entity Framework Code First migrations and learn how to save your data persistently in a database.

The only tools we will use in this course are Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition and Google Chrome. Both are available for download for free.

All source codes and exercise solutions of this course are also available for download, of course.

Learn to build, host and track landing pages or simple web sites, using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Have an idea and need a landing page or simple web site?

Unsure where to start, or worried about costs and flexibility?

Maybe you're just fed up of wrangling with Wordpress?

Well, thanks to some amazing web services, you can build and host your own professional landing page, for simply the cost of your domain name. What's more these landing pages or simple web sites, are more reliable, more flexible and offer greater insights than some of the paid for options.

My name is Ben, and I've been building and selling software for the last 22 years. I have built a popular Elixir programming course on Udemy with over 1.9k students, you can see my five star reviews.

Why a course on landing pages?

All the current landing page solutions frustrate me.

Wordpress requires a database, which means that I'm going to have to understand it, and maintain it. Also Wordpress and all it's plugins need to be updated otherwise you are vulnerable to attacks. Not to mention the associated costs.

Site builder services like LaunchRock and SquareSpace are inflexible and quickly become costly.

Landing pages are often for testing out ideas, if those ideas fail, you don't want to have spent too much on them. Yet if those ideas take off you want to gradually build on them and trust that they are reliable and professional.

So I decided to build this course. Landing pages and simple web sites (those that don't use a database) should have the following criteria:

Cheap yet professional
Easy to set up and maintain
Flexible to accommodate future changes and scenarios
Reliable and fast downloading on my customers web browsers
Use my custom domain name, and allow me to send and receive emails from my custom domain
Capture email addresses using the email platform I choose
Track my visitors behaviours, so that I can get insights into how to sell more effectively to them


By following best practices, cherry picking the best services and using my developer knowhow, I have built a course that fulfils these criteria.

I promise, it doesn’t matter whether you’re 16 or 60, absolutely ANYONE will love this course.
You can take away the skills to make your ideas real. The only limit? Your imagination.

Don't settle for tiresome Wordpress sites, save your money from site builders, and learn how to build and host your own landing pages and simple web sites.

AND REMEMBER… if you are unhappy with this course, then I'm unhappy - I offer a full money back guarantee within the first 30 days of purchase.

And you’ll be amazed how fast you’ll move along.

Contents and Overview

This course is targeted at beginners who have little or no experience with Blender. The pace is initially quite slow, with lots of practice opportunities so that you can get used to the Blender environment. The language is simple and you should have no problems understanding what I’m talking (or writing) about. As we proceed you’ll get familiar with new, more advanced concepts.

This course is divided into 9 sections, each of them covering a broader topic subdivided into lectures. Altogether, there are 43 lectures. The pace is up to you, you can go through the easier parts faster and then take more time to study the more sophisticated ones.

To help you memorize and practice all the new stuff, you go over similar steps repeatedly as you proceed.

After you finish each section, there’s a quiz for you that covers the material discussed in that section.

After you finish this course you will be able to move around the Blender interface, create simple objects and transform them, rig and animate your models as well as texture them. You will be able to use quite a lot of tools and techniques. You’ll know how to keep things organized. This will make a good starting point for more advanced study.

Genre: eLearning Video / Guitar lesson

Fingerstyle Funk will completely overhaul your thinking of what can be played with ten fingers and six strings. With your faithful fingerstyle guru at your side, Jamsire Ernoir (aka Ernie Jackson), will teach you how to create insane grooves, layer chords over the groove, and play a melody over the top - and then play it all at the same time.
Jamsire delivers more than a few jaw-droppers and knuckle-busters. Take your eyes off the video and you won't believe it's all coming from a single guitar. But more than that, Fingerstyle Funk will be a boon to your songwriting, your soloing, and your rhythm playing. You'll learn to add groove and feel to your technique, to use fingerstyle in jam settings, and how to create a full range of rhythmic textures. 

Plus, you'll get some fantastic ideas for playing over loops. And we're not just talking about the single-note "cluck" heard on so many classic funk recordings (due respect, Godfather). Fingerstyle Funk puts the guitar front and center, laying down the basic groove, with an active rhythm part and melody.

This course covers the fundamentals of data visualization that every developer needs to know regardless of architecture, platform, tools, or language.
At some point in your software development career, you may be called upon to produce a graph or a chart. Delivering on even a simple request can be remarkably complex. How much data is there and where does it live? What kind of chart should you use? Should the chart be rendered on a server or on the client? What kind of clients should you support, and what are the consequences of that choice? This course introduces every aspect of visualization, from story, to numbers, to architecture, to code.

AC-3 | 192 Kbps | 48.0 KHz | 2 channels | ~3 hours | 10 GB
Genre: eLearning Video / Fitness, Cardio Workout, Health

20 MINUTES. 5 DAYS A WEEK. 100% RESULTS. When I created the BurstFit FIRE workout, I knew it would produce drastic results in 30 days, but I didn’t know if anyone was up for the challenge. Turns out…there are a lot of people determined to transform their bodies.
Teachers, Moms, College kids, Doctors, Military, and even complete beginners have started to enjoy doing these tough workouts. To like the feeling of being sore the next day…of going all out, and giving it all you’ve got for a muscle-searing exercise. This really IS the most targeted workout I’ve ever created…but it's going to get you jaw-dropping results.

Traditional and long-distance cardio decreases your testosterone levels, decreases the immune system post exercise, and raises stress hormone levels (cortisol). Increased levels of cortisol stimulate the appetite, can increase fat storing and slow down or inhibit exercise recovery.

Burst training involves exercising at 90%-100% of your maximum effort for a short interval in order to burn your body’s stored sugar (glycogen), followed by a period of low impact for recovery.

This causes your body to burn fat for the next 36 hours to replace your body’s vital energy (glycogen) stores. It can burn between 3 - 9x’s more fat, lower your resting heart rate, balance hormones, lower blood pressure, keep your brain young by increasing circulation, and aids in detoxification by stimulating the lymphatic system.

Core 1 Abs on Fire for strength and definition.
Core 2 Belly Fat Inferno for targeted mid-section fat burn.
Cardio turn up the heat with the toughest workout you’ve done so far.
Shoulder Shred Absolutely Lean Arms for sculpted arms, shoulders, chest.
Hot Legs for getting a deep burn as you get lean and toned legs.
Booty Bootcamp for lifting and tightening your glutes with targeted workouts.
Warm Up for getting loose and ready for the burn.
Cool Down to prevent injury and boost recovery.

Improve your ability to manage creativity and to lead an innovation strategy in businesses, schools, hospitals, governments, and other complex organizations and institutions, by diagnosing likely innovation failures before they occur.
About the Course

This course is intended to help you improve your ability to manage creativity, innovation and change in business, education, healthcare, government, and in any other complex organization or institution by diagnosing potential innovation failures before they can occur. Using an “innovation constraints” framework that draws on modern social science research and on insights from business practice, participants will learn how to best manage people (be they co-workers, bosses, customers, clients, friends or any other stakeholders) when innovation is the goal. While we see several examples of technological innovation, we are not focused on the management of technology. Instead, we focus on something much more powerful: understanding and managing the people engaged in creation, innovation and positive change, regardless of the context.

The course is designed to help you answer the following types of questions:

What are the conditions for successful innovation?
What causes innovation to fail?
What makes creative people creative?
How should I manage an innovative team?
How do I lead an effective brainstorm process?
What is an innovation portfolio and how can I manage one?
Why do so many great ideas get killed?
The approach in this class will be to treat innovation as the process of generating, assessing, and then implementing useful and valuable ideas. As we will discuss, generating ideas is relatively easy; what can be hard is getting those ideas listened to, accepted, and implemented in organizations. In addition to learning how to lead creative people and creative teams, participants will also learn techniques for improving their own creativity. During the course you will engage numerous activities and exercises intended to bring current habits of thought and behavior to the surface for examination and change.

Course Syllabus

Week 1: Introduction: Why Everyone Wants Innovation but No One Wants to Change
We introduce the approach of the class: instead of trying to be innovative, just stop stopping it. We discuss a framework for analyzing the six most common barriers (constraints) that stop innovation.

Week 2: Individual Constraints: Why Most of Us Are More Creative Than We Think
Psychologists treat innovation as a problem of having creative ideas; we sometimes stop innovation by not "thinking different". This week explores the constraints of perception, intellection, and expression and offers strategies for overcoming them.

Week 3: Group Constraints: Why a Brainstorm Meeting Can Be Worse Than No Meeting at All
Social psychologists treat innovation as a group problem: we often don't get early support for our ideas because of adverse group dynamics. This week looks at the constraints of emotion, culture, and process in groups as well as the environment within which groups work, and looks at ways to overcome them.

Week 4: Organizational Constraints: Why You’ll Never Be a Prophet in Your Own Hometown
The field of management sees the problem of innovation as one of the organization; organization is the opposite of innovation, after all. This week explores the constraints of strategy, structure, and resources and we explore ways of framing them that will help us to overcome them. 

Week 5: Industry Constraints: If It’s Such a Great Idea, Why Isn’t Our Competitor Doing It?
An economist view of failed innovation sees it as a problem of adoption; when there's no market to adopt it, it's not an innovation, it's just a creative idea. We look at the constraints of competition, suppliers, and markets and discuss strategies you can use to relax them.

Week 6: Societal Constraints: Why My Innovation Means You Have to Change
The sociological and anthropological perspective suggests that societies control or obstruct innovations that are deemed as dangerous or contrary to societal values. This week explores the constraints of identity, social control, and history and we will seek an understanding of how we might avoid them. 

Week 7: Technological Constraints: How to Take a Really Hard Problem and Make It Completely Impossible
Engineers and scientists see failed innovation as a failure of technology; if it doesn't work, it's not an innovation. Here we explore the constraints of knowledge, time, and the natural environment. Rather than trying to overcome them, we develop strategies for working within these constraints.

Week 8: When Failure Is Not an Option: Leading an Innovation Strategy
The final week has us putting the entire model together into the leadership context. We will learn about innovation portfolios and discuss a tested process for moving innovations from ideas to realities.

En el camino al desarrollo web el lenguaje de Programación PHP es el nivel más alto que se debe alcanzar, programar del lado del servidor creando conexiones a base de datos nos permite crear aplicaciones administrables y dinámicas. 

En este curso aprenderemos paso a paso la sintaxis de PHP y la forma de programar con este lenguaje, además complementaremos con la Programación Orientada a Objetos para aprender a realizar patrones Modelo Vista Controlador. 

Es indispensable que toda aplicación dinámica que se realice con PHP cumpla con los estándares de seguridad, para ello aprenderemos a realizar conexiones seguras a la base de datos con PDO y SQL.

Además para que nuestras aplicaciones tengan respuesta inmediata a algunas peticiones del usuario aprenderemos a utilizar AJAX, trabajo asíncrono entre Javascript y el lado del Servidor.

Finalmente en este curso aprenderemos a crear nuestro propio Administrador de Contenidos, para poder ofrecer un sitio web administrable a nuestros clientes.

¿CÓMO ES EL CURSO?

El curso se divide en varias secciones. En una primera sección nos introduciremos en las bases del lenguaje de Programación PHP, aprenderemos a crear variables, funciones, ciclos y condiciones.

Luego aprenderemos la diferencia entre escritura imperativa y el paradigma POO (Programación Orientada a Objetos). Con este Paradigma POO aprenderemos a crear patrones MVC (Modelo Vista Controlador).

En la siguiente Sección aprenderemos a conectarnos a la base de datos de manera segura creando un CRUD (create, read, update, delete) muy completo con PDO y SQL.

Luego tendremos una sección dedicada a la seguridad Informática para tener en cuenta las condiciones de seguridad que debemos agregar a nuestras aplicaciones PHP.

En la útlima sección nos dedicaremos por completo en la construcción de un CMS (Administrador de Contenidos) personalizado para poder hacer dinámicas las páginas web que montamos a Internet.

¿CUÁNTO SE TARDA EN COMPLETAR EL CURSO?

Depende de ti. Estimo que menos de dos semanas puedes completar el curso, pero dependerá de tu ritmo de trabajo y de tu disponibilidad.

Genre: eLearning | Level: Intermediate | Language: English

Building HTML forms for the web world is never as straightforward as expected. Collecting user input, and implementing dynamic form validation that automatically reacts to input, can be difficult without the right solution. When building client-side apps using Angular, you get a good amount of framework code out-of-the-box that makes working with forms a breeze. Angular allows you to easily handle dynamic form validation by taking advantage of two-way data-binding functionality. This course shows how to build HTML web forms using the building blocks, built-in validation properties, and methods of the Angular forms module. Learn how to use the model-driven forms approach to build out a model representation of form data in code and bind it to native HTML form elements. This course also explores how to implement validation, using JavaScript, in case you need more fine-tuned control of your interactions.

What Can An Entrepreneur That Makes Over $1 Million Dollars Per Month Teach You About Building A Million Dollar Brand? … Not As Much As His Clients, Who Have Used This Process To Do The Same In 12 Months Or Less.
Hey. Ryan here.
If you’re on this page, you most likely came from my free training, 0-1 Million in 12 Months.
And you’re looking to develop a new product and build a million dollar brand, using my step-by-step blueprint.
The same blueprint I’ve used to create multiple million-dollar companies.

And more importantly, the same blueprint that has been used by many to:
Create A Million Dollar Brand In A Year Or Less.

I’m not here to brag about my success, or that of our clients.
You already know all of this…
You’ve sat in on the free training.
And you already know why we are doing this…

You’re here because:

You want to learn exactly how to develop a brand that sells products that people want… and 100% confident that you can sell them at healthy profits…
You want to build a brand that stands out from all the competition, because you have something of real value that you feel proud to sell.
You want a brand that people believe in - one that people come back to over and over again - with lifelong customers that support everything you do, and buy everything you create.
How To Get Crystal Clear On Your Product Idea (even if you don’t have the slightest clue what you want to sell)
How To Use Amazon And Other Internet Sites As Research Tools To Guarantee A Winning Product (so you don’t end up creating something nobody wants)
How To Develop Your Prototypes And Product Lines (without getting ripped off or bullied by a supplier)
How To Fund Your Business (and how to do it without raising a single dollar)
How To Find And Correctly Pitch Investors (if you need startup capital)

You’re here because you want to create freedom and security in your life.
You’re here because you want to build something bigger than you.
A business that will make money and make a difference, with or without your involvement.
Something you can build and sell for millions of dollars, or pass onto the future generations of your family.

Who This Is Not For

This is not for those looking to “make a quick buck online”.
If you want to build a million dollar per year brand…
It takes time, focus, and hustle.
If you can’t invest at least $5,000 into your business, and hustle hard for at least six months…
…or at least use our training to raise the money to do so… 
This might not be for you.
But if you understand that success belongs to those that are patient, disciplined, and focused…
And you trust the proven process I’m about to lay out for you…

Brand Builder Bootcamp

Now, if you’re still with me…
If you understand that this course is a way to make the million dollar business happen faster and easier…
If you understand that this will take years off your learning curve, and save you from painful and expensive “trial and error” lessons…
If you know that building a million dollar brand from scratch can be hard work…
If you’re ready to invest in yourself, and put in the work…

How To Have Customers Waiting For You (so that you can take orders and be profitable IMMEDIATELY)

Easy blues guitar lessons for beginners: bar chords w/diagrams, rock 'n' roll & blues shuffle rhythm & lead guitar w/tab

Have you ever wanted to take private lessons from the world's greatest professional guitarist?

Yeah, me too…

How about settling for me instead?

Consider this…

I've played guitar on and off over the last several decades and consider myself to still be an advanced beginner.

Which probably makes me a better guitarist than you.

Another thing to consider…

I seem to be a good teacher.

I've taught several friends how to play blues rhythm and lead guitar.

Now I'm asking you to join the group.

Not because I'm a great guitarist (I'm far from it).
Not because I've developed some revolutionary new teaching method (though I may have).
Not because I'm out to make a million dollars (though, wouldn't that be great?).


I'm asking you to join me because it will be fun… for both of us.

This course is unique in that I'm not a very good guitar player. So, taking this course is more like sharing guitar tips with a buddy. It's less intimidating than spending lots of money learning from a professional.

Come on! Let's play blues guitar together.

There are few things more rewarding on this planet than making music with someone!

We'll begin with learning how to play open E and open A power chords - the core of the blues and rock 'n' roll - using 1 finger per chord.

Then we'll learn to add a B chord using a second finger –- from there we're off to the races…

Power chords, open chords, bar chords. Rock 'n' roll rhythm and the blues shuffle rhythm. It's all here in guitar chord diagrams and tablature.

The course includes information on how to play lead guitar and comes to a climax with a solo blues intro, shuffle, turn around, singing with lead conclusion.

By the end of the course you'll know everything you need to play beginner blues rhythm and lead guitar.

Or your money back. No, seriously.

Udemy offers a 30 day no questions asked money back guarantee on any course purchased. So, there goes your risk!

So, have you ever wanted to learn how to play blues guitar?

Why not join me for a 1-on-1 buddy session while we learn together?

I'll see you in the classroom,

Responsive Wordpress Site Design for Clients
English | 2016 | mp4 | H264 1280x720 | AAC 2 ch | 5 hrs | 1.49 GB 
eLearning

Learn responsive design that meets your client's needs

Charge your clients much more money by creating a WordPress website exactly to their requirements. 

Create a custom responsive WordPress website for a client using the Genesis theme framework on the WordPress platform. 

WordPress provides you with a fairly well-optimised web system. However, combining WordPress with the premium Genesis theme ($59.95) ensures an entirely future-proof, perfectly optimized and responsive web design with the latest CSS3 and HTML5 with Schema mark-up. 

The course shows you everything – from the basics to fairly advanced HTML and CSS tweaking of the child theme. 

After you have finished this course you will have learned how to: 

· Set up a WordPress website on a host's server (both the manual and "one-click" methods) 

· Create a custom "Under Construction" page to display during online development 

· Set up the logo and top navigation menu with drop-downs 

· Set up a blog on it's own separate page 

· Set up social media profile link widgets and understand widgets in general 

· Add content and images to the website's pages and the blog posts 

· Create and style up new sidebar widgets 

· Two ways of adding and editing an image slider with overlaid text 

· Use CSS media queries to ensure the site displays correctly on all browsers and all possible devices (phones, iPods, iPads, tablets, laptops, etc.) – completely understand responsive design 

· Create a contact page with a contact form 

· Create an email subscription list and sidebar form with incentive to join – the most important tactic of internet marketing 

· Display a "favicon" for your site for the browsers's address bars (as well as for iPod Touch, iPads and iPhones) 

· Display a higher resolution logo for retina screens 

· Plus much more! 

I would advise anyone taking this course to have the Genesis theme framework although it isn't 100% necessary. 

This course is ideal for anyone wishing to create a website for themselves or other businesses – for which you could charge $3000+. I have gone into everything in great detail so there's no need to worry if you have very little knowledge of WordPress, HTML, CSS and/or PHP. 

The course would be particularly useful for people who wish to run their own web design business as you would be able to charge four-figure fees for creating a bespoke website like this.

A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. But at the end of the day your team needs to add real business value. Even the best data science teams won't last long in your organization if they can't generate revenue or lower expenses. The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. These short sprints give you real-time feedback to help keep your team on track. A short sprint will also help your team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data. This course shows how to structure your work within a two-week sprint. See how to work within a data science life cycle (DSLC)—a methodology for cycling through questions, research, and reporting every two weeks. Explore key practices to help your team break down the work so it fits within a two-week sprint. Learn how to use tools like question boards to encourage discussion and find essential questions.

with SQL to make Oracle database's robust and run more efficiently.

It includes the standard SQL language as well as Oracle's proprietary extensions to the standard
SQL language.

PL/SQL is high performance and portable.

PL/SQL can also be accessed from the command line using oracle's database built in SQL*Plus.

PL/SQL is closely integrated with SQL and supports various data types.
PL/SQL can also be used in developing web applications and supports object -oriented programming.

PL/SQL allows you to create procedures ,functions ,cursors and Triggers.

In this course we will setup a test environment from scratch by downloading and installing sample oracle database and TOAD.
Once we have our lab fully setup we will then start writing proper PL/SQL syntax.

What You Will Learn in this course:

How to write PL/SQL syntax
How to write procedures
How to create functions
How to create cursors
How to create Triggers

Capture Targeted Subscribers, Build Rock Strong Relationships and Optimize Your List for Long-Term Revenue

If you are not seeing the email channel as a money making machine, you have the wrong strategy ~ Hans Smellinckx

A recent study conducted by the The Radicati Group, a technology research firm, shows that there are 3.9 BILLION accounts. They predict that this number wlll grow to 4.9 BILLION by 2017.

They say email is the Jason Bourne of online apps: somebody's always trying to kill it. It can't be done. So it's safe it assure we still have email marketing for a long time.

List building is probably the fastest and most secure method of creating a stable source of recurring income.

My name is Max and I'm a list builder. I've been collecting email addresses since 2009. I've always known about the relevance of owning your own list and the window of possibilities that opened when you start building yours, but It wasn't until I got the chance to see email marketing from the inside that I decided to do something about it.

For 3 years I worked as the educational content publisher and support team manager of an email service provider (ESP) in the Netherlands called INinbox. Once of the benefits of working there is getting an unlimited account, with unlimited subscriber and unlimited emails with no costs associated. I've been building my lists with that account, and up until this date I have over 85.000 subscribers combined.

Working at an ESP, and building my own lists has given me a lot of insight into the rightful practices of email marketing. What tools to use, what emails to send, where to publish your forms, how to drive in traffic, how to maximize open rates and a lot of other questions have been answered along the hand of years of experience.

I'm now one of the teachers and co-founders of iMarketXL, an education brand focused on providing our students the essential skills needed to build an entire online business from scratch.

In our latest addition to our teaching palette, list building is going to provide you with all the tools, resources and strategies needed to start building your own lists in a unique and comprehensive 3 phase process in which you will see me build yet another list of subscribers from scratch.

Imagine this: A still image close-up of a hand holding a soapy glass next to a stream of water pouring from a faucet. But wait… it's not entirely a still image. The fingers are motionless, and so is the glass and the faucet. But the stream of water? Well, it has movement. It pours and pours. By definition, a cinemagraph is a loop with some moving parts and some parts that don't move at all.

The point of cinemagraphs is to grab the viewers' attention and in this course Photoshop master Andy Anderson will grab yours by showing you how to make them. Students should have a basic working knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and be able to shoot simple videos, or have a source where they can obtain video clips.

Learn what a cinemagraph is and how to discern between a great one and a good one
Understand the equipment and software requirements for producing cinemagraphs
See four different methods for creating cinemagraphs and the best ways to save them
Discover the best ways to record cinemagraph footage for maximum impact

Genre: eLearning Video / Guitar lesson

The "Hendrix Master Class Series" Four DVDs with 5+ hours of step-by-step instruction. Five professionally made, full-band Hendrix-style jam tracks with YOU supplying the guitar so that you’ll already sound like you’re on stage. Learn 70 white-hot licks broken down completely, move by move.
DVD 1
"Tower Groove Rhythm" Module

Wanna play rhythm like Jimi? Then watch this DVD as you learn how to incorporate the minor pentatonic scale in your own rhythm playing by using the different positions in the scale in conjunction with hammer-ons and pull-offs. And then to add melodic licks we'll chain the chords in the progression together. Sweet!

You’ll also learn simple ways to get that Hendrix sound and spice up your 3 chord minor chord progressions. Finally, use octaves to get exciting melodic ideas in both your rhythm and lead playing and use them to move your lick all over the neck. Time to break out of the box!
"Tower Groove" Lead Module

Here we learn the all-important standard first position for Hendrix-style pentatonic licks. But that's not all! You'll also learn:

How to use unison bends as well as whole step and step and a half bends and vibrato to add tension and feeling to your phrases.
Chain positions together to expand your usage of the fretboard and to give you more options when soloing.
Use different techniques like position shifts, bending, octaves, vibrato, and traveling from high to low strings all in one area of the fretboard to make simple but exciting riffs the "Jimi way."
Use easy chords with hammer-ons and pull-offs that follow the progression to make target note soloing a breeze; sound like you know what you are doing by just varying your picking hand technique to turn rhythm into lead playing.
Learn riffs that use and chain every position in the pentatonic scale together.
And additional material too extensive to list here!

DVD 2
"Axis Of Rhythm" Module

Learn to incorporate and understand all of the rhythm ideas used in Jimi's masterpiece. "Bold As Love."
Learn the E, A, and D inversions off all of the chords to open up the fretboard in ways you never dreamed possible.
Learn the classic R&B style riffs that are essential to being able to use Hendrix's rhythm approach in your playing.
Use the rhythm licks to open up and show you new ways to add tons of major pentatonic lead lines and how to become more melodic in your lead playing.
Learn how to SEE the scale shapes inside the chord shapes so target note soloing becomes easy as pie 
And MUCH MORE!

"Bold As Leads" Module

Learn to solo in the dreaded major pentatonic scale and how to easily understand how to use it by learning to see the chords in the scale positions.
Concentrates on melody and seeing target notes to effortlessly create the same memorable lead lines that Jimi was famous for.
Learn to mix major and minor pentatonic scales to get those cool notes that don't seen to fit in the common pentatonic boxes.
In the final lick on this DVD we learn all-out pentatonic madness by using both major and minor pentatonic scales as well as how to apply chromatic runs in your lead lines to take your playing to the next level.

DVD 3
"Manic Progression" Module

Here I'll show you how to play a song in the exact style of Jimi's epic song, "Manic Depression." You'll also learn how to play in different time signatures and how to add that "swing feel" to your playing. Not only that, but you're also going to learn how to use scales, chords, and the infamous "Hendrix Chord" together to write killer riff-based rhythms that you can use in your songs. Awesome!

You'll also learn:

How to weave in and out of lead and rhythm playing so that you can be playing lead and then effortlessly come back to rhythm parts to lock in the hits with the band and then get right back to the leads before the listener ever knew what happened.
Lots of sliding riffs and unison bends to add flavor and tension to add emotion to your solos.
Tons of great first position bending and hammer-on and pull-off licks.

"Foxy Jam" Module

A music critic once described Jimi's classic "Foxy Lady" like this: "If one song could be said to encapsulate Hendrix’s entire oeuvre, 'Foxy Lady' is certainly closer than most."

And that's why I used this song as my inspiration in this module. You're going to master how to write riffs in this amazing style, and you'll also learn to develop picking accuracy by jumping from low to high to middle strings in one passage.

The importance of right and left hand muting.
How to take a pentatonic position and a couple of chords and write an entire song.
Learn the importance of right and left hand muting.
Learn cool and unique sliding and bending riffs totally unique to Jimi.
Learn cool and unique sliding and bending riffs totally unique to Jimi.
Learn how to add other scale tones and half note bends to your lead lines to get that mystical Jimi sound found in many of his solos.

DVD 4
"Floor Groove" Module

We ain't done yet! On this DVD we'll be carrying on with the theme of riff-based rhythm pentatonic playing by learning some of the concepts used in the amazing Jimi track, "Killing Floor." By doing this, you'll learn how to tighten up your rhythm chops by add syncopated funk style riffs add double stop runs in your lead riffs. You'll be blown away by how this sounds coming out of your guitar!

We'll also take everything we've learned so far and turn it up a notch. What do I mean by that? Well, it means I'm going to give you challenging but rewarding riffs that, once learned, will give you more confidence in your rhythm and lead playing. This is HUGE. You'll immediately see the benefits carry over to ALL aspects of your guitar playing.

Finally, we'll finish things off by giving you some more challenging syncopated rhythmic riffs that we'll need for future Jimi lessons to come!
Gear Section Module

For those of who who REALLY want to dial in that Hendrix sound with even more precision, I created a whole separate lesson module on gear! I will literally show you all the gear I used to get the sounds in this lesson series. And I'll give you examples on how to achieve some of those classic Jimi tones on your own.

Whether it's employing different pedals and amps, I'll show you how to get it done, "from cheap to boutique" to cover all budgets. It will help get you one step closer to that Jimi sound!

Cryptography ensures confidentiality and authenticity of digital documents. The mathematics behind cryptography show us why, and how far, it can be trusted.
The Java and .NET frameworks contain all the algorithms you need to keep your users' data secret from prying eyes. Web servers like Apache, Tomcat, and IIS, combined with tools like OpenSSL, keep your users secure online. But to use these tools correctly, and to avoid mistakes of the past, you must understand how cryptography works. Learn the math behind encryption and digital signatures. Study examples of how it has been misused, and explore the possibilities that cryptography enables in digital currency and collaboration.

In this course, we build two applications to highlight the power of Ember.js from the basics all the way through to moderately advanced topics.
Ember.js is fast becoming a favorite MVC JavaScript framework for many web developers. It's opinionated, a bit difficult to learn, and amazingly powerful once you understand a few key concepts. We'll build two applications in this course: a Github explorer, which uses jQuery AJAX and the Github API, and then a UserAdmin screen for ASP.NET MVC 5's Identity System.

For over 60 years, thousands of men and women, told by their doctors that they were dying, have recovered from deadly diseases - lung, breast, liver, pancreas, melanoma, lymphoma, and other cancers, lupus, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, migraines, and more - by following the safe, natural, and proven Gerson Therapy, using fresh, organic fruits, and vegetables to heal the body.
Vol. 1 Overview and Patient Testimonials:
On this DVD, Dr. Gerson's daughter, Charlotte Gerson, presents the histy and they of The Gerson Therapy. Inspiring testimony of healed Gerson patients demonstrate some of the extradinary recoveries achieved with The Gerson Therapy. Learn how diet, environmental toxins, chemicals, and drugs reduce immune function. The Gerson Therapy restes depleted vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and other nutrients through consumption of fresh, ganically grown fruits, vegetables, and juices. Toxic residues are eliminated through safe, effective detoxification. The body's natural defenses are stimulated and rested. Damaged, depleted body systems are regenerated, allowing f remarkable recoveries from terminal, degenerative illness and numerous lesser conditions.

Vol. 2:
From this double disc set, Charlotte Gerson, provides practical infmation and guidance f those who are using the Gerson Therapy principles at home. Recded live at one of the Gerson Institute's educational seminars, it includes four hours of infmation, resources, common pitfalls, and question-and-answers.

Vol. 3:
In this volume of the educational DVD series, Charlotte Gerson shows how anyone can prepare delicious, healthy Gerson Therapy meals and juices quickly and easily. The Gerson Therapy has over a 60 year track recd of success. Over 200 articles in medical literature document its effectiveness. Since 1977, the non-profit Institute has trained physician, scientists, and the public on the healing and prevention of degenerative diseases.

The Gerson Therapy is a natural treatment that activates the body’s extraordinary ability to heal itself through an organic, plant-based diet, raw juices, coffee enemas and natural supplements.
With its whole-body approach to healing, the Gerson Therapy naturally reactivates your body’s magnificent ability to heal itself – with no damaging side effects. This a powerful, natural treatment boosts the body’s own immune system to heal cancer, arthritis, heart disease, allergies, and many other degenerative diseases. Dr. Max Gerson developed the Gerson Therapy in the 1930s, initially as a treatment for his own debilitating migraines, and eventually as a treatment for degenerative diseases such as skin tuberculosis, diabetes and, most famously, cancer.

The Gerson Therapy‘s all-encompassing nature sets it apart from most other treatment methods. The Gerson Therapy effectively treats a wide range of different ailments because it restores the body’s incredible ability to heal itself. Rather than treating only the symptoms of a particular disease, the Gerson Therapy treats the causes of most degenerative diseases: toxicity and nutritional deficiency.
An abundance of nutrients from copious amounts of fresh, organic juices are consumed every day, providing your body with a super-dose of enzymes, minerals and nutrients. These substances then break down diseased tissue in the body, while coffee enemas aid in eliminating toxins from the liver.
Throughout our lives our bodies are being filled with a variety of carcinogens and toxic pollutants. These toxins reach us through the air we breathe, the food we eat, the medicines we take and the water we drink. The Gerson Therapy’s intensive detoxification regimen eliminates these toxins from the body, so that true healing can begin.

How the Gerson Therapy Works
The Gerson Therapy regenerates the body to health, supporting each important metabolic requirement by flooding the body with nutrients from about 15- 20 pounds of organically-grown fruits and vegetables daily. Most is used to make fresh raw juice, up to one glass every hour, up to 13 times per day. Raw and cooked solid foods are generously consumed. Oxygenation is usually more than doubled, as oxygen deficiency in the blood contributes to many degenerative diseases. The metabolism is also stimulated through the addition of thyroid, potassium and other supplements, and by avoiding heavy animal fats, excess protein, sodium and other toxins.
Degenerative diseases render the body increasingly unable to excrete waste materials adequately, commonly resulting in liver and kidney failure. The Gerson Therapy uses intensive detoxification to eliminate wastes, regenerate the liver, reactivate the immune system and restore the body’s essential defenses – enzyme, mineral and hormone systems. With generous, high-quality nutrition, increased oxygen availability, detoxification, and improved metabolism, the cells – and the body – can regenerate, become healthy and prevent future illness.

Juicing
Fresh-pressed juice from raw foods provides the easiest and most effective way of providing high-quality nutrition. By juicing, patients can take in the nutrients and enzymes from nearly 15 pounds of produce every day, in a manner that is easy to digest and absorb.
Every day, a typical patient on the Gerson Therapy for cancer consumes up to thirteen glasses of fresh, raw carrot-apple and green leaf juices. These juices are prepared hourly from fresh, raw, organic fruits and vegetables, using a two-step juicer or a masticating juicer used with a separate hydraulic press.


Watching this complete DVD set will provide a more thorough understanding of how the therapy works, methods for home application, and everyday practicality of the Gerson Therapy. Each volume contains lectures presented by Charlotte Gerson describing topics ranging from the history of the therapy to enema procedure to juicing techniques. The DVDs complement material presented in Healing The Gerson Way and offer a visual representation for ideas overviewed in the book.

Ok peeps, here is installment one of the long awaited Metal Method Complete Guitar Course. It also has the benefit of having a metafile overlay which allows you, if you use a player like VLC media player, to toggle the playlist. This will allow you to skip around each lesson and see each part and what time it plays within the list. If all of this sounds confusing which it was to me at first then just click on the .m3u file and when it activates your player, your playlist should come up automatically. I've included the overlay for those of you that are curious but you don't need to unzip because I've already done that for you. It won't hurt anything if you want to try it out though. Just unzip the overlay file into the current directory with the weekly files. Enjoy, have fun, and feel free to leave me any questions or comments and please seed.

Built and managed by Google, AngularJS is one of the most powerful front-end frameworks in the world.

If the internet was created today, AngularJS's core functionalities would have been built-in on day one. That's the mindset the developers had when they were creating AngularJS… how would we create a framework that would fix all of the core issues with the beginning of the internet? 

Here's a simple concept: <h1></h1>

If you're familiar with HTML then you know this to be a heading tag which has default formatting on all web browsers. In short, it makes text stand out.

What if you wanted a tag like: <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>? Like just that tag? With it's own default formatting and function? With AngularJS this is downright simple. It's called a directive and something you'll learn in this series.

How about easy filtering of content in a list? Or ordering? These things can be done using other technology but AngularJS makes is super simple. 

This course is here to teach you the fundamentals of AngularJS to build a blog application complete with filtering, directives, searching, typeahead, ordering, ngResource, and much more.

Bifrost in Maya 2017 is a revolutionary liquid simulation system. In this course, you will see how this system, traditionally used for large-scale simulations, can also be used for small-scale simulations. Software required: Autodesk Maya 2017.

Though Bifrost is traditionally used for large-scale simulations, you can gain a powerful tool if you adjust this system to suit your needs. In this course, Maya Dynamics: Bifrost for Small Scale Simulations, you will first take a look at how you can work with gravity, liquid density, surface tension, and viscosity to change the typical large-scale behaviors of Bifrost liquids. Next, you will explore how you can change or turn off many of the adaptivities that traditionally make Bifrost a very fast and powerful large-scale simulator, but may cause quality issues with small-scale simulations. You will finish the course out by lighting and rendering out fluid in Arnold in Maya 2017. By the end of this course, you'll have good foundational knowledge of adapting Bifrost to suit your needs for small-scale simulations. Software required: Autodesk Maya 2017.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

This course will teach an individual the process for choosing the correct Franchise amongst the 3,500 that exist.

The course covers the basics of how to select the correct franchise that will fit your work requirements and lifestyle. This course will also help people decide if they want a Franchise business instead of attempting to start it on their own.

I wrote a book on Franchising called, "Buying a Franchise: 24 Items to Beware of Before Signing". I will distribute this to all participants in the course.

There are five 16-18 minute sessions recorded. It could be from one week to four weeks depending on the students pace.

The course is structured according to a series of questions that I would ask an individual to find a custom Franchise for their needs. I continue from one session to the next with further questioning on different topics. I also describe different Franchise topics as we proceed. I tell the participants that they can email me and I will respond to their questions in 24 to 48 hours. At the end of the course, they can also sign up at my website for a free Franchise Consultation; if that is something they desire. 

Participants should take this course if they were laid-off from their job or they want a work life change and would now like to work for themselves. Some individuals would like to start a Franchise as an investment and keep their present position, because there are semi-absentee and absentee Franchises that give you this opportunity.

Introduction to Flare and Flame Assist
English | October 2014 | mp4 | H264 1440x900 | AAC 2 ch | 6 hrs 5 min | 3.91 GB 
eLearning | Course Number: FLR101

This new Flame Assist & Flare course is designed to get artists up to speed quickly and give them an inside track on the newest editions of the software before they are released to the public. You’ll learn many of the tools that editors and assistants need to know in order to do time-consuming support tasks, such as project setup, media management, advanced conform, as well as archiving and restore. You’ll also learn how to work on more complex shots that require color correction, masking, tracking, and green screen composting.

Course instructor and flame artist Michael Furey maintains an active involvement with Autodesk as a beta tester for Flame and has more than twelve years of experience as an editor and compositor. The course begins with a clear overview of each application, the differences between them and how they fit into the Flame Premium family. After that, we'll conform a timeline and work on shots with a project-based approach to learning them. Our goal is to have course members be able to execute entry to intermediate level tasks on Flame Assist and Flare that would be expected of them at a post production facility.
course syllabus

Class 1
In this class I'll show how to configure each app, create a user profile, explain the user preferences, start a project, discuss the user interface, and import an XML from an offline edit.

Class 2
I'll show you how to conform a timeline, match it to the reference Quicktime, and rebuild some effects using timelineFX. I'll also introduce you to working in BatchFX.

Class 3
In this class we will go over the desktop and how to keep it organized. We will talk about the paint tool and demonstrate how to use it for shot clean up. And we will import some graphics into our project and discuss the various ways to composite them.

Class 4
In this class we'll talk about and work in BatchFX in order to create a tag page for our promo using several different compositing techniques, including Action.

Class 5
In this class I'll demonstrate some color matching techniques using the Color Warper, tracking within Action, and we'll finish the promo that we've been working on.

Class 6
In this class we will start a project in Flare and discuss the differences between the two apps. We will also do a selective color correction and sky replacement in Batch.

Class 7
In Flare we will use GMASKS to remove the visible camera crew from a shot. Then we will use 2 point tracking to stabilize the shot and color correct it using a LUT Editor.

Class 8
In this class we will work inside Flare to white balance a shot using the Color Warper, create text using the Text node, and use the Planar Tracker inside Action.

Class 9
Using the Modular Keyer in Action we will composite a green screen sequence. I'll also demonstrate how to use Pixel Spread and Degrain to fine tune the composites.

Class 10
In this last class we will talk more about how to share media and setups between the two apps. We will also cover archiving and matchbox shaders.

Genre: Development / Programming

It's deja vu all over again. In the old days (35 plus years ago), developers wanting to write half-decent programs had to know their hardware. Those days are back. Clock frequencies have peaked and hardware can no longer be abstracted behind high-level languages.

Designed for developers with high performance requirements (games, finance analysis, scientific computation, etc.), this course teaches you what really happens when programs are executed and the subtle details that make a program go slow or fast.

With a focus on concurrency, specifically local concurrency (multi-threading), the course is all about writing efficient programs that make the best use of the computing resources available to you. While the sample code is written in C++, the course is not C++ specific. If you can read C++ code, but don’t use it in your work, you will still learn from this class.

Learn how programs execute in hardware and the subtle details that affect program speed
Practice writing efficient programs that get the most out of today’s CPUs, caches, and memory
Discover how single and multi-core CPUs interact with memory and how to avoid memory slowness
Explore memory models, concurrent data structures, lock-free concurrency, and lock-based concurrency
Acquire the tools needed to measure the performance of programs and their components

We all know that marketing is the core of the success in any business. Marketing translates first of all into geting as much exposure for your business as possible. It's business and it's a numbers game. If 100 people come into your store and out of them 5 people buy something than you know that for 20 buyers per day you need 400 people to get through your doors on a daily basis. You have to get those people there somehow!

Till a couple of years ago, even with the help of the internet, which changed the world of marketing forever and gave acces to small business at audiences they didn't even dreamed about, you couldn't afford as a starting entrepreneur mass marketing campaigns like the the BIG players in the global marketplace.

But now we have a solution, a solution that everyboday can access and get their business exposed in front of millions for people for just a few thousand dollars, a few hundreds or even for FREE. Yes, for FREE! It's called Social Media and by far Facebook is the most important platform of them all.

Now, with the help of Facebook, thousands of business got to a whole new level forever. Marketing on social media properly can change the way you are doing business forever and can build you an automated sales funnel that works for your business non-stop!

The problem is that you need to do it properly so that you won'w waste any money on ads that don't convert and posts that don;t attract any new clients. This is exactly what you will learn in this course.

Even more than that, the main difference between our course and many others is that we don't focus only on ads and page marketing but we also teach you how to bring in new valuable clients by using your Profile!

So, to go briefly through a couple of the things you will learn here they are:

This course is divided into 9 sections, each of them covering a broader topic subdivided into lectures. Altogether, there are 71 lectures. The pace is up to you, you can go through the easier parts faster and then take more time to study the more sophisticated ones.

To help you memorize and practice all the new stuff, there are lots of exercises for you to do as you proceed.

After you finish each section, there’s a quiz for you that covers the material discussed in that section.

After you finish this course you will be able to move around the Blender interface, create simple objects and transform them. You will be able to use quite a lot of tools and techniques. You’ll know how to keep things organized. This will make a good starting point for more advanced study.

Forged from the creation of his 111 Public Television "How to Paint" episodes, Gary has perfected his popular step-by-step teaching method for watercolor . Rather than progress from an "easy" painting to a more difficult painting, Gary starts his students on "any given painting." Choose "the subject" (the painting) that you prefer, and Gary will walk you through its creation from start to finish.

It has been his experience that by breaking the watercolor painting process down into easy-to-follow steps, students can take on any of his painting compositions—thus progressing more rapidly. Gary’s proven teaching method will make you a better watercolor painter!

231 <--> Erlang Programming for Beginners
http://nitroflare.com/view/4C082DF03A70371/EProg.rar


Erlang Programming for Beginners
English | 2016 | mp4 | H264 1280x720 | AAc 2 ch | 2.5 hrs | 436 MB 
eLearning

Understand what Erlang is and be able to write small Erlang programs

Coders are in high demand in virtually all industries nowadays – a trend that is only set to continue in future years. For that very reason, finding employment as a programmer is increasingly competitive. Adding Erlang to your list of programming languages is a fantastic way to stand out from the growing crowd of job-seeking coders. It's a unique language that has its own specialised niche, so having it in your arsenal is definitive proof that you're a pro. 

- Expand your knowledge of programming languages 
- Understand what Erlang is and where it came from
- Write your own small Erlang programs
- Add an esoteric language to your repertoire
- Gain a new, unique perspective of coding

Write your own Erlang Program 

This Erlang for beginners online course offers an extensive introduction to the world of Erland. Designed with complete beginners in mind, it features 30 lectures and 2.5 hours of content that will teach you all of the Erlang basics (and more besides). 

You'll learn about the origins of Erlang, what makes it so different to other languages, and work your way up to building small, compiled programs with this rare language. The emphasis is on hands-on, practical experience, so be prepared to dive straight in at the deep end. 

Beginning with installation, features and syntax, you'll quickly get to grips with creating functions with Erlang, conditional flow and looping and working with process IDs. Then it's into the core of Erlang; lists, recursions, comprehensions, pattern matching, types and type conversions, exception handling, records and more. If it sounds complicated, don't worry; our expert tutor will guide you every step of the way. 

By the end of the course, you'll know how to build basic programs with Erlang and will have a solid foundation of knowledge to build on. If you're an aspiring programmer of any kind or even an experienced one looking for a new challenge, then this course is for you. 

Tools Used 
Erlang is a functional programming language originally developed by Ericsson to build software for its telecommunications products. It's completely different to most other programming languages out there, and is in fact more like an operating system than anything else. It can be used for a variety of tasks including monitoring systems and distributing databases, among others.

This course will teach you how to go beyond simple asserts and use human intelligence to test both new and legacy code.
ApprovalTests is an open source library that enables unit tests to go beyond simple asserts. It allows complex verification of system output that would otherwise be hard and time-consuming to implement using conventional asserting. It is also an essential tool to quickly get legacy code under test before refactoring it.

Genre: Development / Programming

Build and develop your own multi-purpose real-time websites with Redis and Socket.io.

Discover the simplicity of Redis to make web applications faster than before
Create unique web servers and networking tools with Node.js
Implement real-time applications on websites using Socket.io with Express and Redis

Unity is a cross-platform, exciting and popular engine in the game industry. This video course shows you how to use Node.js to build websites, and focuses primarily on Express as the framework that the website will be built in. In addition to Express, we cover the use of Redis and Socket.io to make more robust and dynamic sites. Many courses only focus on one of these, but this course covers all of them.

By the end of this course, you will be able to build applications using Express, Redis, and Socket.io. Express helps by making full-featured web applications easy if you know how. Redis opens doors by making data quick and easy to fetch. Many sites have used Redis to make difficult data problems easy. Lastly, Socket.io makes two-way communication between the browser and web application easy. If you have ever needed to build something that was real-time, then Socket.io is what you want to use.

MPEG Audio ~224 Kbps | 44.1 KHz | 2 channels | 00:18:18 | 391 MB
Genre: eLearning Video / Health, Rehabilitation, Massage

This is a well-illustrated guide to spinal manipulation techniques in the context of osteopathic medicine. It describes the principles and theory of spinal manipulation, its use in clinical practice, and the techniques used in working with all levels of the spine, thorax, and pelvis. Detailed instructions guide the reader through 35 different manipulation techniques. A troubleshooting guide helps readers understand problems they might encounter. In addition, a free CD-ROM is included with the book. It features video clips of the techniques being performed.
Review

The conservative management of spinal pain syndromes requires the development of many skills including the necessary psychomotor skills to perform joint manipulation. Skill acquisition is not automatic and requires progressive steps of motor learning and frequent refreshment of learning. This novel text and accompanying CD-ROM aims to support practitioners’ learning and acquisition of manual skill to perform high velocity, low amplitude spinal manipulations and is likely to provide a valuable resource for both teachers and students of manipulative therapy.

Gwendolen Jull Mphy GradDipManipTher FACP

Associate Professor and Head of Department of Physiotherapy, The University of Queensland, Australia

Peter Gibbons and Philip Tehan have taken the extremely difficult subject of the actual skill teaching in HVLA technique and produced what should prove to be a real milestone. Having been teaching this subject since 1964, I fully understand the problems that they have faced, and their frustration in trying to help students climb the learning curve at a faster rate than is usually possible. The inclusion of a companion DVD with video is clearly the way forward and the no-nonsense approach to making this work available across boundaries of like-minded disciplines is to be applauded. I highly commend this work to all those working in the manipulative fields. I believe that it will help raise the standards of knowledge of manipulative practitioners world-wide as well as confirming the logical thinking and educational process of osteopathic practitioners.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Many people are lured by fabulous returns in options trading. But what does it take to become an expert - find out here.

The biggest mistake committed by newcomers to Options trading is they do not realize that Options trading has a learning curve. Options have a foundation in mathematics, and all the parameters that govern Options pricing (the critical element in Options trading) are dictated by mathematical formulas. Failing to understand the theory and mathematics behind Options is the single biggest factor most people don't succeed in Options trading. They don't understand why they lose money or why the trades they expected to be winners turn out to be losers.

The second biggest mistake most people make is that they don't have a clear idea of the roadmap in the Options trading game. They trade strategies they don't fully understand. These two factors combined can deal a deadly blow before they learn the game.

Don't get caught in this situation. Watch this FREE COURSE to know what you're up against. Learn the challenges and the pitfalls of Options trading so you know what to expect. Once you know this, you can plan methodically, and you will be well on your way to making Options trading a reliable second income for life.

LEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS

OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY, IMPLIED VOLATILITY, OPTION GREEKS

BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES

SECTION I - Call Options

Most people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details.

SECTION II - Put Options.

The Put Option is the ultimate "protector" of your portfolio, and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option, and just like we did in the Call Option, we consider a real-world example of a Put Option.

SECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies

In this section, three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies.

Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for
Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for
Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own
SECTION IV - TIME DECAY

Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact, time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the course, we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are "wasting" assets, and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.

SECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY

Implied Volatility is the "wildcard" in Option prices. Ignore it, and you will pay a price. In fact, it's so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility, Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility, and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.

SECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS, DELTA, GAMMA, VEGA, THETA

If you're the pilot of an aircraft, the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don't manage your instrument panel properly, well…you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta, the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller's dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you'll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention, you can then fly your aircraft on "auto-pilot" (with help from the Greeks).

SECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE

The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like "Long" and "Short", we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment, as well as things like Expiry series, Bid-Ask spreads, Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important, and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor, and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin.

SECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL)

Buying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this course, we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and "moneyness" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days, and we navigate the trade to its exit point.

SECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF)

Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course, we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and "moneyness" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to "let your winners run" in a controlled manner.

SECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION

The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies, but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful "4 strategies box" to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly, what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing, but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index"), trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters.

SECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS

This course studies the need for Option adjustments, and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a "pain point" - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments, over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor's outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.

Intermediate Modeling and Texturing in Modo
English | April 2015 | mp4 | H264 1440x810 | AAC 2 ch | 2.36 GB 
eLearning | Course Number: MDO203

This course, led by Pat Crandley, aims to help artists create Sub Division Surface Models in Modo. In this course you'll explore of the tools, techniques and, most importantly, the thought process behind creating high resolution geometry for your scene. Understanding the role of the sub division surface algorithm will help you plot out the edge flow of your model and help you create fine geometric details and textures.

In addition to exploring the sub division surface modeling framework, you'll also explore the UV mapping process in Modo. The UV mapping tools in Modo quickly produce strong results and the strategy behind the technique will be developed throughout the UV mapping stage. We'll explore some great additions to the UV mapping tool set in Modo and look at how to create UVs for tricky geometry. We'll wrap up the UV Mapping module by looking at the UDIM framework in Modo as we look to send our UVs to your favorite texture painting application.

To conclude, we'll explore the procedural generation inside of Modo. A majority of the texturing detail can easily be created with procedural textures. Combined with group masks, procedurally created textures paired with great UV maps will yield us great results. 3D modeling and texturing can be a laborious process. Great 3D modelers don’t work hard, they work smart. This course aims to arm you with the strategies and techniques to get you to your final render faster.

Pat Crandley has been a 3D modeler, animator and editor in the computer animation and visual effects industry for over 10 years. Crandley served as the Post-Production Supervisor for the 3D Animation department at MTV and oversaw the production of a computer animated series called Video Mods. He also worked as the lead modeler and animator for a series of commercials for Coke, Mike’s Hard Lemonade and Debers Diamonds. Currently, Pat is teaching the next generation of 3D modelers and animators at Sacramento City College and The Art Institute of California: Sacramento.
course syllabus

Class 1
Layout and Rough Geometry. To begin, we are going to explore the overall shape, form and proportions of the model. Once we have examined our reference and laid out our battle plan, we'll start roughing out the shape using the simple shape creation tools in Modo. An analysis of the form will yield us some interesting information and help us determine the correct application of the tools and technique. At the end of the day, we are going to be initially modeling a fourth of the chest and then let our mirroring tools do the rest of the work.

Class 2
Sub-Division Surface Modeling Working with Sub-Division Surfaces can be a challenge. We'll start off by exploring how sub-division surfaces work and talk about how the algorithm influences the model. Through our exploration, we'll start to see how we can influence the intensity of the algorithm by strategically inserting geometry into our model. Pixar Sub-Division Surfaces are awesome, but they are not without their considerations. Creating the top of the treasure chest will test our skill and help us understand the role of edge loops, edge weight and controlling curved surfaces with the correct polygonal flow. Fall-offs will help us achieve the type of shape we are after. If everything goes according to plan, you should have the top of your chest completed this lesson!

Class 3
Creating and Controlling Curves. No treasure chest is complete without a little treasure to go inside! We'll explore how to create a few of treasures that will go inside the chest. To create our gold coins, goblets and gems we'll take a look at the differences between the Modo curve tools, duplication tools, explore the amazing Modo snapping engine and discuss different approaches to creating cylindrical shapes. There be gold in this chest!

Class 4
UV Mapping. Now that we constructed all of the geometry in the scene, we'll need to start building UV maps to accompany the models. This lesson is going to be all UV mapping, so we'll start off by talking about the strategy of UV mapping and explore how the tools help us achieve the result we are after. The UV mapping tools are really great, so we'll explore how they all work and the benefits of each. The Unwrap Tool is the most powerful tool in our arsenal, so we'll spend a lot of time exploring how it works and the direct benefits of apply this tool to our scene. There are some really great free plug-ins for UV mapping that make the Modo UV mapping process really easy, so we'll take a look at those too.

Class 5
Duplication and Replication. Now that we have created our treasure and made their UV maps, let's take a look at how we are going to place it inside the chest. All of the UV information will get duplicated with the geometry, so its a great idea to have the UV maps wrapped up by now. The Modo duplication system has a few different facets, so we'll explore the pros and cons of duplicating items, creating instances and replicating geometry. At the end of the day, the coins, goblets and gems are going to be static items, so replicators should give us the best result for our scene. We'll have to create a point cloud, so we'll explore the different ways to achieving this result and duplicating our geometry.

Class 6
Creating the Environment. We've spend the last 5 lessons creating our treasure chest and now it is time to create an environment for the chest to live within. Great images are accompanied by a simple environment that provides context to the focal point of the render. We'll rough out the spatial relationships between the objects in our environment, places trees, rocks, an ocean and some cool rock structures far-off in the background of our scene. We're building a world this lesson!

Class 7
Texture Generation. The fastest way to ruin a great model is to put a horrible texture on it. We'll start putting textures on our treasure chest. Believe it or not, but the majority of textures that were used to create the final render were created right here in Modo using the procedural texture generation engine. We'll explore the full spectrum of procedural texture that we can create in Modo and some techniques to apply them to our model. Masking materials and material groups in the shader tree will help us create the illusion we are after, so we'll spend a lot of time exploring the masking system. In addition, we are going to be blending a lot of layers together, so we'll explore how the blend modes work too!

Class 8
Baking. Modo has a really great texture baking engine and we are going to be want to take advantage of it for our scene. Part of being a great 3D modeler is creating assets and scene that are optimized for rendering, so we have a responsibility to the rest of the production pipeline to make our scenes render efficiently. Baking normal and ambient occlusion maps will help us extract high resolution detail from our geometry and place it on lower, more render efficient objects. In addition, we'll take a look at the cage based baking system in Modo and compare the results to the default system.

Class 9
Nodal Shading. The nodal shading system in Modo allows us to connect different channels from different items in the shader tree. With this system in hand, we can create highly customized effects that are controllable and efficient. The Rounded Edge shader and occlusion shader will be big players in the nodal shading system for our treasure chest. The values of one item will influence the values of another.

Class 10
Final Rendering. Well, its come down to this……the final render. We are going to take a look at a few different approaches to rendering our scene. we'll start off by exploring the composition of our render. At the end of the day, we are in the business of creating 2D images so the framing of our object is important. Of equal importance are the camera settings. We should always being exploring how we can achieve a more photographic render so creating depth of field is a critical component to the success of our render. There are a few different approaches to creating depth of field, so we'll explore those too. In addition, we'll also take a look at how the physical sun properties will effect our environment. We'll wrap up the course by exploring the different render outputs we'll need to create and set up all of our render passes for final compositing in Photoshop.

I am happy to say that over the course of 2015 alone I more than doubled my network which now stands at just over 2500 people. I've been to dozens of conferences, having overcome my fear of public speaking.

I used to be very shy and unsure of myself, so going to events with rooms full of strangers was completely out of the question. I am so glad those days are behind me and in 2015 I discovered the hidden power of MeetUp and how you too can leverage this app to grow your network.

Please join me for the essentials needed to grow your network and personal brand.

Great video production almost always depends on camera support, such as a tripod, shoulder rig, or stabilizer, but shooting handheld can be liberating (and far less expensive). You can shoot faster and go to places where bulky equipment would be prohibitive.

But how do you ensure you still get decent footage? In this course, you'll learn a few simple methods for shooting stable video with just your hands and body for support, plus a few bonus accessories that help add points of contact for even more stability.

Learn as you paint this watercolour one step at a time, gaining confidence as you mix colours and paint wet into wet.

This delightful and atmospheric painting will help build confidence for both the beginner and the intermediate. In the process of painting this you will learn about colour mixing, colour values, creating a sense of distance and how to use your watercolour pencils for a special effect.

Use both a large and small brush and gradually work through the process at your own pace, as where and when it suits you.

Each lecture ends at a natural break as I wait for paint to dry. Listen as I explain every step of the way, and ask questions of myself as I work through the picture, problem solving as I go, an important process to learn.

Most of all become absorbed in the process of the painting.

If, however, you don't enjoy it and are not happy you can claim a full refund within 30 days. No questions asked.

Structured Note Taking Vol 2: Create a Mistakes Journal
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 3.5 Hours | Lec: 23 | 7.47 GB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Create a Mistakes Journal to keep track of all your mistakes so that you can find solutions and patterns in your data.

Everyone makes mistakes.

Everyone has failures.

But what do you make out of those mistakes? 

Out of those failures?

Do you learn from them?

Do you really learn from them?

What I mean by that is…how long does it take for you to forget what you learned?

How many times have you found yourself making the same mistake over and over again?

That's what this system is designed to solve. 

It's designed to be a single place where you eventually will have years worth of data on all the mistakes you make, big and small.

But it's not just a place to store mistakes.

You could just as easily call this a "solutions" journal.

This thing….it's not just about mistakes and solutions… it's also a place to analyze both your mistake and brainstorm multiple solution options.

Over time, you will be able to come back and look at both the mistakes you've made and the solutions you've come up with to solve them.

We all have a lot going on.

It's really easy to make a mistake and forget about it hours or days later.

Sometimes you have a solution in mind, sometimes you don't.

Failure can happen because you didn't know what to do, or because you knew what to do but didn't have the will or motivation to do it.

The mistake most people make is that once they make a mistake or have a failure, then never do anything about it.

They never address the issue.

And often times the problem, as well as the solution, have to do with the systems you have operating in your life. 

So when you let a problem fester, you opening up yourself to a lot of other related and down stream problems.

The mistakes journal also has a mechanism for you to track the progress on the solution to each mistake so you know if the solution has been implemented or not.

One mistake may cost you a little, it may cost you a lot.

But a lot of little mistakes also cost you a lot.

Especially when you are making the same mistakes over and over and over again.

Over the course of the next new months and years, you should expect to save hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of your own time, money, energy and opportunity cost by keeping an organized mistakes journal.

Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework that allows you to quickly and easily build applications for the web. It's a framework designed with developer productivity and happiness in mind. With Rails you can create web applications with very little effort through strong conventions, sensible defaults and a great set of libraries. If you want to get started building web applications, Ruby on Rails is a great place to start!
In this course, you'll learn about developing web applications with Ruby on Rails. We will build a simple task and project management tool together. In so doing, we'll cover the foundations of Rails: models, controllers and views. We'll also go further, touching on most of the key features of the Rails framework: validations, migrations, the asset pipeline, email delivery, internationalization, AJAX integration and more!

This course is about the quantum mechanics of light. Classically, light consists of electromagnetic waves, which are fully described by Maxwell’s equations. On the quantum level, however, this description has to be extended to introduce the concept of the photon.
Quantum Optics is about how light is described in terms of photons, and how the interaction of photons with matter such as atoms can be understood. We will see that, on the one hand, things that we take as a given in a classical description can be naturally derived in the quantum optical context from fundamental principles. On the other hand, the quantum descriptions allows for novel types of light with properties that can not occur with a purely classical description.

Quantum optics also predicts some very counter-intuitive effects such as an optical coupling to empty vacuum - which can be experimentally tested and have actually been confirmed in laboratories around the world!

We’ll help you understand the basics of AngularJS thoroughly with a practical “how-to” approach to working with data. This course is designed to help you to understand the basics of AngularJS quickly and thorough. AngularJS is basically a JavaScript framework (an open source web application framework) library, which is distributed as JavaScript file. Mainly used in developing Single Page Application (SPA). It extendes HTML with additional new attributes hence making simple development and making it more responsive at user’s end, since HTML was never design for dynamics views. AngularJS is very easy to understand hence learning it is a fun. Every feature of it can be modified as per the the requirement.

To learn AngularJS you should have a basic understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will have access to source code of lecture (wherever applicable).

Unlike traditional courses that concentrate mainly on theory, we'll take a practical “how-to” approach to working with data.

This will have access to source code of lecture (wherever applicalbe)–––- course will cover following AngularJS topics

-Introduction to AngularJS
-Your first simple Hello World App
-Angular Expressions
-Abstracting the controller into a module
-2 Way data handling
-Usage of ng-repeat, ng-show, ng-hide & ng-if
-Form submissions

Genre: Video Tutorial / NativeScript, Angular 2, Cross-Platform Mobile, JavaScript

Writing cross-platform mobile apps is hard. On one hand, it can save money to use a JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile framework. But on the other hand, we'd like to be able to give app users the speed and elegance of a native app.
Well, NativeScript is a cross-platform mobile framework that lets us have the best of both worlds. With NativeScript, we can write apps using the web technologies we know and love: CSS, ES6, and even frameworks like Angular 2.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to build a cross-platform native app with NativeScript and Angular 2. You'll get to try out the TypeScript language, and you'll learn how Angular 2 and NativeScript can work together. You'll get hands-on practice with some of the most important NativeScript components—like buttons and activity bars that render with native Android and iOS components. You'll also understand how to connect NativeScript with Angular 2 concepts like routing. And by the time you've finished, you'll have built a simple but functional native app, with a Firebase back-end.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Note: the videos in this course cover Angular 2 Final, and the lessons code is updated to Final

For building the service layer in Angular 2 we have many options available. Should we build a service layer in a similar way to Angular 1, or are there better ways ? How do we use the new HTTP module ? Everything around this module revolves around the notion of Observable. What is an Observable?

The goal of this course is to answer these questions by introducing the fundamentals of RxJs and Functional Reactive Programming and see how these notions apply in practice to the Angular 2 HTTP module. We will learn how to use the HTTP module and Observables to build service layers in Angular 2.

Covering RxJs completely would be the subject or a very large course, but the good news is that if we we are planning to use RxJs mostly to do HTTP calls, then we can focus on only a small subset of operators.

The course structure is simple: we will introduce RxJs and Observables and give a couple of simple examples, and aply it directly by using it to build the service layer of an Angular 2 Application. We will then see how to do the most common HTTP operations that you will do the most often in practice. RxJs does not have to be hard, we can approach it gradually and a great way to jumpstart our understanding of it is to use it in a very concrete case: in the case of this course we will focus on the Angular 2 HTTP Module.

Master the art of manipulating files within a distributed storage enterprise platform. It's easier than you think!

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It has many similarities with existing distributed file systems.

We will be manipulating the HDFS File System, however why are Enterprises interested in HDFS to begin with?

However, the differences from other distributed file systems are significant.

HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and is designed to be deployed on low-cost hardware. 

HDFS provides high throughput access to application data and is suitable for applications that have large data sets. 

HDFS relaxes a few POSIX requirements to enable streaming access to file system data. 

HDFS is part of the Apache Hadoop Core project.

Hardware failure is the norm rather than the exception. An HDFS instance may consist of hundreds or thousands of server machines, each storing part of the file system’s data. The fact that there are a huge number of components and that each component has a non-trivial probability of failure means that some component of HDFS is always non-functional. Therefore, detection of faults and quick, automatic recovery from them is a core architectural goal of HDFS.

Applications that run on HDFS have large data sets. A typical file in HDFS is gigabytes to terabytes in size. Thus, HDFS is tuned to support large files. It should provide high aggregate data bandwidth and scale to hundreds of nodes in a single cluster. It should support tens of millions of files in a single instance.

A computation requested by an application is much more efficient if it is executed near the data it operates on. This is especially true when the size of the data set is huge. This minimizes network congestion and increases the overall throughput of the system. The assumption is that 
it is often better to migrate the computation closer to where the data is located rather than moving the data to where the application is running. HDFS provides interfaces for applications to move themselves closer to where the data is located.

Grasp why "Big Data" knowledge is in hot demand for Developers / Consultants and Admins

There are more job opportunities in Big Data management and Analytics than there were last year and many IT professionals are prepared to invest time and money for the training.

Why Is Big Data Different?

In the old days… you know… a few years ago, we would utilize systems to extract, transform and load data (ETL) into giant data warehouses that had business intelligence solutions built over them for reporting. Periodically, all the systems would backup and combine the data into a database where reports could be run and everyone could get insight into what was going on.

The problem was that the database technology simply couldn’t handle multiple, continuous streams of data. It couldn’t handle the volume of data. It couldn’t modify the incoming data in real-time. And reporting tools were lacking that couldn’t handle anything but a relational query on the back-end. Big Data solutions offer cloud hosting, highly indexed and optimized data structures, automatic archival and extraction capabilities, and reporting interfaces have been designed to provide more accurate analyses that enable businesses to make better decisions.

Better business decisions means that companies can reduce the risk of their decisions, and make better decisions that reduce costs and increase marketing and sales effectiveness.

What Are the Benefits of Big Data?

This infographic from Informatica walks through the risks and opportunities associated with leveraging big data in corporations.

Big Data is Timely – A large percentage of each workday, knowledge workers spend attempting to find and manage data.

Big Data is Accessible – Senior executives report that accessing the right data is difficult.

Big Data is Holistic – Information is currently kept in silos within the organization. Marketing data, for example, might be found in web analytics, mobile analytics, social analytics, CRMs, A/B Testing tools, email marketing systems, and more… each with focus on its silo.

Big Data is Trustworthy – Organizations measure the monetary cost of poor data quality. Things as simple as monitoring multiple systems for customer contact information updates can save millions of dollars.

Big Data is Relevant – Organizations are dissatisfied with their tools ability to filter out irrelevant data. Something as simple as filtering customers from your web analytics can provide a ton of insight into your acquisition efforts.

Big Data is Authoritive – Organizations struggle with multiple versions of the truth depending on the source of their data. By combining multiple, vetted sources, more companies can produce highly accurate intelligence sources.

Big Data is Actionable – Outdated or bad data results in organizations making bad decisions that can cost billions.

In this class I would like to share a very simple and easy-to-learn workflow to use in editing your landscape photography (DSLR or mobile phone) to make them look dramatic and vibrant. This is my "go-to" workflow in the beginning stages of editing and, with just a few easy to understand tools in Adobe Lightroom, can completely transform your photos into the kind of photo that you envisioned when you first took it.

Some of the tools we will be using in our edit:

-Crop/Straighten using a grid

-Basic adjustments to color temperature

-Adjusting exposure/highlights/shadows/contrast/clarity

-Using the HSL (hue, saturation, luminance) sliders to achieve dramatic colors

-Removing chromatic aberration in tree limbs automatically and manually using lens corrections

-Brushing colors by hand into the photo

-Adding clarity/sharpness with adjustment brushes

-Using adjustment brushes to edit lighten underexposed areas

Build a Distributed Cluster of Hortonworks 2.5 Manager and Agent nodes with a single command! Includes Spark 2.0!

A combination of VirtualBox and Vagrant will transform your desktop machine into a virtual cluster. However this needs to be configured correctly. Simply enabling multinode within Vagrant is not good enough. It needs to be tuned. Developers and Operators within large enterprises, including investment banks, all use Vagrant to simulate Production environments. 

After all, if you are developing against or operating a distributed environment, it needs to be tested. Tested in terms of code deployed and the deployment code itself.

You'll learn the same techniques these enterprise guys use on your own Microsoft Windows computer/laptop.

Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.

This course will use VirtualBox to carve out your virtual environment. However the same skills learned with Vagrant can be used to provision virtual machines on VMware, AWS, or any other provider.

If you are a developer, this course will help you will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you are used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration. Say goodbye to "works on my machine" bugs.

If you are an operations engineer, this course will help you build a disposable environment and consistent workflow for developing and testing infrastructure management scripts. You can quickly test your deployment scripts and more using local virtualization such as VirtualBox or VMware. (VirtualBox for this course). Ditch your custom scripts to recycle EC2 instances, stop juggling SSH prompts to various machines, and start using Vagrant to bring sanity to your life.

If you are a designer, this course will help you with distributed installation of software in order for you to focus on doing what you do best: design. Once a developer configures Vagrant, you do not need to worry about how to get that software running ever again. No more bothering other developers to help you fix your environment so you can test designs. Just check out the code, vagrant up, and start designing.

I guess I was comparing my marketing to other dance teachers. Who been teaching dance for years, but also marketing dance badly for years too! I can tell you from experience now. The most successful dance business start off as rookie dancers, but understand a bit about marketing, and business. They develop dance skills or hire good dancers to teach for them as their dance business grows too! :)

Providing you know how to teach a beginners dance, yoga, fitness class or if you're dance studio owner you can hire teachers teach dance for you! :) You can use these dance marketing ideas to get more dance, yoga, fitness students to your classes today! :)

If you have a clever anecdote, an interesting memory, a new way to explain how something works, or an opinion on a social or political issue, then you have an essay in you. Unlike a novel, history book, or scientific publication, essays provide you with the versatility to express all the various facets that make you you. The concise and direct nature of an essay means that you may tap into your sense of wit, share your individual point of view, persuade others to your perspective, and record a part of your memories for future generations in as many distinct essay forms as you wish.

Genre: Development / Programming

Leverage the small but powerfully-formed Flask framework and its extensibility.

-Get an in-depth look at the Python web micro-framework
-Take advantage of Flask’s extensibility to perform advanced web application development
-Develop a real-world application using best practices to reduce its development and maintenance time

Flask is a small and powerful web development framework for Python. It is called a micro-framework as it aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Even though it’s called a micro-framework, it is no way lacking in functionality, and allows you to develop applications very quickly, primarily through the development of a small codebase.

This course will take you deep into the world of using Flask and its ecosystem of extensions to create web applications. We’ll walk through creating a simple IMDB clone from scratch. We’ll start by creating the boilerplate code and use Virtualenv to create an isolated development environment. You’ll then learn to work with the database using SQLAlchemy. After that, we’ll display our data to the end user using WTForms.

We’ll restructure and modularize our code using Blueprints. Our site will be secured using the extensions Flask-Login and Flask-Principal. After that, we’ll create a RESTful API of our app. We’ll then give admin functionality and extend our app using various flask extensions. We’ll incorporate Celery to make our tasks asynchronous. We’ll walk you through performing unit test of our app, and then test our SQLAlchemy models. We’ll also test the URLs and finally, we’ll test how much of our code isn’t being tested. All these tests will make our app secure. Finally, we’ll deploy our Flask app to various options that are available.

This course will give you an in-depth understanding of how to use Flask and its strong extensibility for more complex web applications.

Genre: eLearning | Level: Beginner | Language: English

It is crucial to maintain a network secure enough to prevent sophisticated attacks, especially if you are part of an enterprise organization. Some of the more dangerous threats to your systems are Trojans and backdoors, which get into computers and compromise the integrity of the system. Data leaks, dissemination, and destruction are just some of the unfortunate outcomes caused by such attacks. Join cybersecurity expert Lisa Bock in this course as she explains how to identify vulnerabilities in your system, and how to then take countermeasures to prevent unwanted access. Lisa explains how hackers can use a Trojan to penetrate a network and lists the methods and tools that they use. She follows up by sharing how you can perform ethical hacking of your own system to detect areas of susceptibility, so you can address the flaws and defend against attacks. She also discusses rootkits, SSDP amplification attacks, ICMP, and more. Note: Learning about ethical hacking for Trojans and backdoors is part of the Malware competency from the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) body of knowledge.

Build secure web applications with Python.

Flask and Python combined can help you build and structure effective Web APIs. In this course, you will get an understanding of how REST works relative to APIs, and we’ll cover how to test APIs written in Python with the support of Flask. We will then progress by securing our web APIs with HTTPs. The use of Python allows testers to write system-specific scripts, or alter and extend existing testing tools to find, exploit, and record as many security weaknesses as possible just as professional hackers do. By the end of the course, you will learn various cyber attacks modify existing tools to suit your application’s needs.

This path navigates across the following products (in sequential order):

Web API Development with Flask (1h 40m)

eLearning | NativeScript, Angular 2, Cross-Platform Mobile, JavaScript, JavaScript ES6, ECMAScript 2015, Firebase, Front-End

Writing cross-platform mobile apps is hard. On one hand, it can save money to use a JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile framework. But on the other hand, we'd like to be able to give app users the speed and elegance of a native app.

Well, NativeScript is a cross-platform mobile framework that lets us have the best of both worlds. With NativeScript, we can write apps using the web technologies we know and love: CSS, ES6, and even frameworks like Angular 2.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to build a cross-platform native app with NativeScript and Angular 2. You'll get to try out the TypeScript language, and you'll learn how Angular 2 and NativeScript can work together. You'll get hands-on practice with some of the most important NativeScript components—like buttons and activity bars that render with native Android and iOS components. You'll also understand how to connect NativeScript with Angular 2 concepts like routing. And by the time you've finished, you'll have built a simple but functional native app, with a Firebase back-end.

This course is all about you … your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both. It will be a fast paced tour of the most important experiments in psychology, one that is intended to fascinate, inform, and provoke deep thought. Come learn about yourself with us!
This course highlights the most interesting experiments within the field of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our understanding of the human mind and human behavior. We will explore the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory, learning, attention, perception and consciousness. We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior. Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.

The fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without appreciating how interesting they are. However, we are also routinely influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences. By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding and appreciation of who you are and how you work. And I can guarantee you that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself and others. How can you resist that?!

Intermediate MARI Techniques
English | January 2014 | mp4 | H264 1440x810 | AAC 2 ch | 11 hrs 5 min | 8.35 GB 
eLearning | Course Number: MAR201

In this intermediate MARI course, taught by Mikey Rogers, we explore the powerful features introduced in Mari 2.0. We want to emphasize that we are also opening up the course to Mac OS X users as Mari 2.5 now supports Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) and above! We want to keep things simple but still build on each preceding lesson, so we are going to concentrate on just two hero assets with a few supporting assets. Our end result will be a fully painted human jet pilot placed in an environment to give her a sense of purpose and history.

We start things off by going over the basics of preparation and asset creation as well as explain the benefits of a tiled UV workflow. This will give us a chance to explore the model, think about the types of textures we need and talk about why finding valuable reference is an important part of the texture painting workflow.

The rest of the course will take us step by step on painting each part of the jet pilot from clothes to accessories to skin. Since we want to tell a story with our textures, we spend some time in the later classes painting up a destroyed jet wing as well as a simple floor and background to give the environment a mood and sense of completion.

Finally, we want to make sure you understand how your maps will be used in the next part of the visual effects pipeline. To accomplish this, as we finish each class, we test our maps in the widely used look development plugin VRay. This should leave us with a little bit of time to finish off the course with some basic lighting if desired or instead to allot additional time to finesse our textures. We will leave this up to you.

Mikey Rogers is a Computer Graphics Generalist with a concentration in Texture Painting, Look Development and Lighting. He got his feet wet at Method Studios where he first used Mari in its infancy, testing it before it was released to the public and has pushed for its use at every studio he has since worked at. He has had the pleasure to work for such prestigious studios as Buck, Rhythm & Hues, The Mill, Imaginary Forces, Digital Domain and Pixomondo to name just a few. His portfolio includes work completed on feature films such as Let Me In, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked! and Beautiful Creatures in addition to a bevy of design- and visual effects-related commercials, video game magazines and cinematics for Toyota, Lexus, Cadillac, Comcast, MTV, Sony, Target, Keebler and many more.
course syllabus

Class 1
Prep and asset creation. Tiled UV Workflow. We spend this class to talk about the characteristics of the model we are working with, the screen space that it intends to take up and the mood we wish to convey as well as the type of concept art we wish to find that will help speak for our intentions. This all directly correlates to the types of textures that we are going to paint down the line. It is an extremely important step as it drives what we do for the remainder of the course. We also talk about why Mari thrives with tiled UV assets.

Class 2
General base layer overview. We start things off by getting a basic base layer on the model. This gives us a chance to talk about Mari's procedural painting tools as well as why color keys are important for parts of the visual effects pipeline, like animation. We also talk about image import, shader creation in Mari and VRay and map export.

Class 3
Jump suit. This is where we start painting our first maps using the paint-through tool and we start talking about how to use filters as well as the new paint and adjustment layers found in Mari 2.0 to tweak our projections after we baked our textures down to maintain a nondestructive workflow. We explain the difference between copying and sharing layers and how masks can be used to affect other channels in our shaders.

Class 4
Gloves, shoes and accessories. Here we move onto other parts of the asset where we can explore different types of materials and textures. This will also give us a chance to talk about how to copy baked maps from one UV tile to another, a very efficient workflow in getting detail to the rest of your model in an effortless way.

Class 5
Helmet and head. Time to talk skin! Here we work with some face and head projections, create subsurface maps, eye maps and show an alternative way to do eyelashes. We also paint up the helmet with decals and incandescent maps if you want to add lights inside the helmet.

Class 6
Finalize pilot. We wrap up our lesson on skin and subsurface and review the helmet while making sure our entire asset is balanced and to our liking. This is super important before we move on to next week where we start adding our base wear and tear and add little things like decals, etc.

Class 7
LightBrush. We take a look at the ins and outs of LightBrush which will effectively paint lighting information out of our source photography. It does this by taking in a few inputs from the user and it then separates illumination from reflectance, giving us a flat image that we can directly use in Mari. This shaves hours off the cleanup process and is just amazingly fun to use!

Class 8
LightBrush + Jet Wing Continued. We are pushing the use of LightBrush a little further with a real-time demo of how to use the textures we shot in LightBrush and unify (color correct) them for use in Mari. A little more time is spent on blending these maps together on the geometry and we get a preview of how this will work once we get to our grunge lesson next week.

Class 9
Grunge. This week we discuss the power of shared layers, particularly when used as masks between channels. We spend a bit of time talking about how to consolidate and cache your completed base layers to speed up Mari as well. This allows us to delve into creating detailed grunge maps for when we want to both eat away at surfaces as well as paint blood and dirt across multiple objects in our scene.

Class 10
Final. We wrap things up by making sure you have got a firm understanding on what your grunge maps are doing for you. To do that, we spend a bit more time in Mari to show what you can do with them in the texture painting phase. Then we jump to VRay to create a rendering pass for the grunge maps. Finally, we take things to Nuke where we do a quick composite of all the lighting passes and show you how you can even further change the look of your grunge maps (and character), even in the final stage of the visual effects process.

earn How to Design, Publish & A/B Test a High-Converting Landing Page Without Coding to Generate More Leads & Sales.

Learn how to create a killer landing page that will generate more leads and sales for your business.

Who can sell your product better, a good sales guy or a random employee from the company – like an office administrator or an accountant?

You guessed it right. The sales guy's entire purpose is to convert and sell.

What he wears, how he talks, how he interacts with clients, things he says and when he says them are all tailored towards one single goal – to convert.

The difference between using a landing page for you marketing campaigns and using a page on your website is the same as having your accountant sell your "diet books".

But many entrepreneurs and marketers still make the mistake of directing traffic from their marketing campaigns to their main website and are obsessed with getting more and more traffic.

But what's the point of driving a bunch of new visitors if they immediately leak out through a hole in the bottom?

A clever marketer approaches this challenge with the mind of a scientist. He creates a dedicated landing page with a single purpose and then A/B tests, tweaks and optimizes to squeeze as many conversions as possible.

Sure, there are great tools out there that will help you create stunning landing pages, but what's the use in buying a car if you don't know how to drive?

In this course, I will teach you everything you need to know about creating a highly optimized landing page that will become your conversion machine.

You will learn secrets and hacks behind this amazing marketing tool. I will show you lots of examples by other companies — how they made it and how they screwed up.

In section 4 we will build a landing page together with an easy-to-use drag-n-drop landing page builder called Instapage.

Towards the end, you will be able to submit your landing page to me, which I can review in one of the Bonus Lectures. This is where I take landing pages made by my students, and review them once a week. I give both design and marketing advice and try to put you on the right path.

Not many Udemy instructors provide feedback and coursework reviews. But I believe, to learn a skill as quickly as possible, it is important to receive a feedback from the teacher.

Have you heard of A/B testing? It's this trending marketing practice that can bring amazing results for your landing page. Barack Obama was able to raise extra $60 Million in campaign donations by using this technique. I will show you how they did it and how you can use the power of A/B testing.

How to work faster in your Access databases, even if you have been using Access for years.

Imagine a Monday morning. You've just gotten in the office, said your "Hellos", your "How was your weekends", and you sit at your desk and start your computer.

You push your cup of green tea, or coffee to the side. You start up Access, and you pause.

You have data to enter, or reports to run and e-mail, or both.

Maybe you need to write queries.

If you have ever hesitated because you thought it would take too long, or it was just too cumbersome, you might be surprised on the amount of time that can be saved, the data entry errors that will never happen, with the knowledge of just a few tips and tricks.




Here's how to get started:

Do you or your co-workers use Microsoft Excel, but need your data imported into Access?
Take a look at Section 2: Tables.

Are users entering in data that is not appropriate for the fields, or do they need extra help knowing what data to enter?

Do you want to create drop-down boxes that display information based off of data in another drop-down box?


This course will show you how.

Grouping, totaling, and setting page breaks for reports in Access can, at times, be difficult.
Watch the lectures in Section 4: Reports to help you.

From wildcards, to parameter queries, to action queries, go beyond the basics with Section 5: Queries.

Macros will save you time with Access databases. Get an introductions to the Macro Builder Window, and learn to create a few macros in Section 7.

Learn how to help users quickly navigate to the tables, forms, and reports that they need most by completing the lectures in Section 8: Start up & Navigation.

Maintenance is so important to the life of your database, so take a look at Section 9, for an introduction to the tools that you need to know to keep your database running smoothly.



This course can be completed in hours, but the information can last a lifetime.

So if you are beyond the beginner stage in Access, and want a convenient way to learn Access Tips & Tricks, I invite you to enroll.

This is not an advanced Access course, though advanced users are welcome, and might benefit from lectures within the course.

Take a look at the course curriculum to help decide if this informative, easy-to-follow course is for you.

Core Data is a core competency for Apple developers—but it's notoriously complex, confusing, and crash prone. Luckily, much of this is resolved with iOS 10's new Core Data APIs. Everything has improved: syntax, architecture, performance, and support to recall and undo several layers of changes. Even the whole data container has been simplified. It's all built into iOS and macOS, and it's the recommended way for Apple developers to work with any nontrivial data. This course is meant for the enterprise developer who wants to get up to speed with the latest methods with Core Data. Instructor Jon Bott starts with a review of the basics, explaining the different architectural data models currently in use, the issues that can arise from these different models, and how the latest changes in Core Data 2016 simplify these models. He wraps up with hands-on migration to the new APIs and further tips on leveraging them in iOS 10 and macOS 10. 12 apps.

I'm Josh Adams, the CTO of a mildly successful software consultancy that does cool stuff (isotope11.com). I'm an expert rubyist and have built systems that handle a billion plus worth of transactions per year (I sadly do not get a cut). I've architected large projects for customers ranging from state agencies to federal agencies, and built tons of startups' apps.
Having said that, I'm new to Erlang and newer to elixir (though I have built an actor model based financial trading platform in ruby with celluloid). The premise of the series is that I will learn elixir as a professional developer that is very experienced, and you will come along for the ride.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this entire format is inspired by Avdi Grimm's RubyTapas. If you like this, you're bound to love RubyTapas.

Take your Scrum Master skills to the next level! Are you a Scrum Master? Are you not sure how to facilitate the key Scrum meetings? Do you want to learn how to collaborate with managers? Do you want to learn how to communicate through conflict? Then this course is for you!
This course is the fastest path you can take to 'level up' your Scrum Master skills.

This course is for people who have taken a one to three day course on Scrum (or have equivalent experience) and want to ‘raise the bar’ on their skills. Introductory Scrum courses tell you ‘what’ you need to do but not ‘how’ to do it. This course shows you, through detailed examples and checklists, ‘how’ to be a Scrum Master.

In this course, you will learn:

The mindset of successful Scrum Masters. You will learn how your mindset influences your actions and how to construct an effective mindset.

How to create your daily, weekly, and monthly rhythms. What do you need to do every day as a Scrum Master? What do you need to do every week and every month?

The ABC technique: How to build relationships with key people in your organization to increase the success of your Scrum teams.

EXACTLY how to facilitate the planning, review, and retrospective meetings. When you become an effective facilitator, you will radically improve your team’s cohesion and velocity.

A way to communicate through conflict. Learn how to break down every difficult conversation into four steps.

How to collaborate with managers on Scrum. You will learn what managers care about and how they think about Scrum. You will learn how to set up and launch an Enterprise Agile Team.

The characteristics of a servant leader and how to increase your ability to serve the team.

You will get tools and checklists that take the STRESS out of being a Scrum Master.

In addition to the course material, you will receive two one-on-one 25 minute coaching sessions with me. I will share with you what I’ve learned training and consulting at Carbonite, edX, Paypal, Symantec, Philips, Verizon, and a dozen other companies. You will also be invited to a group monthly coaching call. In addition, you’ll be able to ask questions at any time using the questions area of the course. This is like having a PERSONAL TUTOR as you ‘level up’ your Scrum Master skills.

Who am I? I am the co-author of Professional Scrum with Team Foundation Server, author of “Your Brain on Scrum”, former VP of Corporate Strategy at Softricity, founder of Inquira (acquired by Oracle), and a PhD in Computer Science from MIT.

I am here to pump you up as you deepen your understanding of Scrum and improve your Scrum Master skills!

The course is designed to be taken over eight weeks. If you follow this plan, you will spend approximately half an hour per day on the course. The first one or two days of every week will focus on videos and during the remainder of the week you will be doing assignments.

Warning: This course is HARD. I like to say, “Practice in proportion to your aspirations.” If you are ready to sweat blood to become a better Scrum Master, I invite you to look at Section 3 of the course to see if this course is a good fit for you.

What am I going to get from this course?

Over 40 lectures and 4.5 hours of content!
Over 20 homework assignments
You will get tools and checklists that take the stress out of being a Scrum Master
You will learn the mindset of highly successful Scrum Masters
You will learn how to set your daily, weekly, and monthly rhythm
You will learn EXACTLY how to facilitate the planning, review, and retrospective meetings
You will learn how to collaborate with managers
You will learn a way to communicate through conflict
You will learn the characteristics of a servant leader

Tutsplus - JavaScript Without jQuery
English | 28 Nov 2016 | mp4 | H264 1280x720 | AAC 2 ch | 13 min | 167 MB 
eLearning | JavaScript, JavaScript ES6, ECMAScript 2016, jQuery, Programming Fundamentals, Front-End

There is no doubt that jQuery revolutionized front-end coding. Not only did it simplify cross-browser JavaScript, but it also introduced new ways of doing common things, like working with the DOM or making HTTP requests. In fact, many parts of today's standard API were heavily influenced by jQuery. But we've reached a point where today's major browsers have excellent standards support, and the standards themselves have evolved to make writing code easier.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you that you really don't need jQuery. Follow along as he takes some existing jQuery-dependent code and converts it to plain ol' vanilla JavaScript.

Kurt Johnsen - Body Slimming Yoga
DVDRips | AVI/XviD, ~995 kb/s | 640x480 | Duration: 01:38:32 | English: MP3, 128 kb/s (2 ch) | 1.18 GB
Genre: Yoga, Health

Join the Cheerleaders and their official Yoga instructor Kurt Johnsen for a series of Yoga practices inside the heart of Texas Stadium. Kurt's style of Yoga is proven to sculpt and strengthen the body while promoting peace of mind. Choose between a 25-minute or 45-minute practice designed to promote fat loss and strengthen all muscle groups. Each practice allows you to follow along at beginner, intermediate or advanced levels so you can set the intensity of your program!

The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have decided to give us three different workout videos to try and get ourselves into good shape like they are. These three videos are the actual workouts that they use. Now, while I can't promise that you'll ever look like they do, I can promise that if you stick with Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Body Slimming Yoga, you're going to get in better shape!

If you've never tried yoga before, you have no clue how hard it can be! You might want to try out the introduction to yoga on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Hard Body Boot Camp just to get used to some of the moves before trying out an entire workout. Yoga is meant for training your body and your mind at the same time. This video will give you a great workout on both.

The DVD is divided up so you can choose to do either a 25 minute session or a 45 minute session. These are completely different sessions. The 45 minute one is not just 20 minutes added onto the 25 minute session. I really like that the instructor explains all of the positions very well, so that you know what you're supposed to be doing. I can't promise that it's easy to get the hang of, but at least you know what you're supposed to do. The thing about yoga is that it's not difficult aerobics. You're not going to be out of breath throughout this video. But your muscles will start burning very quickly! Until you get used to all these moves, some of them are going to be very difficult to hold in place as long as they do. Personally, I felt that I was doing well as long as I held the position longer than I did the day before. Improvement is the key to getting stronger and learning the secret of yoga. I have never actually done yoga before so I can't tell you how this really compares to other yoga videos (the previous one I bought was only played for a few minutes), but I can tell you that I enjoyed it and learned a lot. I believe this is one program I will stick with.

The Bonus Features include a breakdown of the basic positions. This is actually probably the best place for you to start if you're like me and haven't done yoga. He explains all the positions even better than during the workout. It's very important to get all the positions right so that you don't injure yourself! There's also an exercise warm-up routine made up from mixed martial arts warm-ups. It's a good warm-up really, and it makes me miss going to Taekwondo class. It's not really very different from normal workouts, but there are some additions. In addition to this, there's an introduction to Tai Chi in the Bonus Features as well. I did recognize some of the moves there from the yoga portion, so I'm really not sure what the huge difference is in Tai Chi and yoga, but from what I can tell, Tai Chi is more active than yoga with more movement but similar moves.

* Instructor-Guided Position Breakdowns
* Mixed Martial Arts
* Introduction to Tai-Chi and Kung Fu Conditioning

Deploy a Hadoop cluster (Zookeeper, HDFS, YARN, Spark) with Cloudera Manager's Python API. Hands on.

Deploy a Hadoop cluster (Zookeeper, HDFS, YARN, Spark) with Python! Instruct Cloudera Manager to do the work! Hands on. Here we use Python to instruct an already installed Cloudera Manager to deploy your Hadoop Services.

.The Cloudera Manager API provides configuration and service lifecycle management, service health information and metrics, and allows you to configure Cloudera Manager itself. The API is served on the same host and port as the Cloudera Manager Admin Console, and does not require an extra process or extra configuration. The API supports HTTP Basic Authentication, accepting the same users and credentials as the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.

.

Here are some of the cool things you can do with Cloudera Manager via the API:

Deploy an entire Hadoop cluster programmatically. Cloudera Manager supports HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, ZooKeeper, HBase, Hive, Oozie, Hue, Flume, Impala, Solr, Sqoop, Spark and Accumulo.
Configure various Hadoop services and get config validation.
Take admin actions on services and roles, such as start, stop, restart, failover, etc. Also available are the more advanced workflows, such as setting up high availability and decommissioning.
Monitor your services and hosts, with intelligent service health checks and metrics.
Monitor user jobs and other cluster activities.
Retrieve timeseries metric data.
Search for events in the Hadoop system.
Administer Cloudera Manager itself.
Download the entire deployment description of your Hadoop cluster in a json file.

Additionally, with the appropriate licenses, the API lets you:

Perform rolling restart and rolling upgrade.
Audit user activities and accesses in Hadoop.
Perform backup and cross data-center replication for HDFS and Hive.
Retrieve per-user HDFS usage report and per-user MapReduce resource usage report.

.

Here I present a curriculum as to the current state of my Cloudera courses.

My Hadoop courses are based on Vagrant so that you can practice and destroy your virtual environment before applying the installation onto real servers/VMs.

With a single command, build an IDE, Scala and Spark (1.6.2 or 2.0.1) Development Environment! Run in under 3 minutes!!

This course enables you to package a complete Spark Development environment into your own custom 2.3GB vagrant box.

Once built you no longer need to manipulate your Windows machine in order to get a fully fledged Spark environment to work. With the final solution, you can boot up a complete Apache Spark environment in under 3 minutes!!

Install any version of Spark you prefer. We have codified for 1.6.2 or 2.0.1. but it's pretty easy to extend this for a new version.

Why Apache Spark …

Apache Spark run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.
Apache Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports cyclic data flow and in-memory computing.
Apache Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. And you can use it interactively from the Scala, Python and R shells.
Apache Spark can combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.


Apache Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.

Formulas and worksheet functions are the heart of Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. They are essential to manipulating and obtaining useful information and insight from your data.

Without formulas and functions, Excel spreadsheet is simply a fancy word-processing document. Welcome to my Excel Formulas and Functions for Beginners course!

Let’s discuss now what you will learn from this course.

Operators and Precedence of Operators: I will start from zero and if you don’t know about the operators and precedence of operators that Excel uses in its formulas, then it will be tough for you to decode complex Excel formulas. So I have covered them very details.
How to use built-in Excel functions: Then you will learn how to use built-in excel functions into the formulas using Insert Function and Function Arguments dialog box.
Subtotal Function: You will find many uses of Subtotal function if you are using Excel with your Finance related jobs. So this function is covered in details at the start of the course.
Relative, Absolute and Mixed Cell References: You will work with these three concepts time to time when you will build excel formulas. So, they have got a good time in the course.
Formulas with Tables: Understanding how formulas work with Excel tables is very important. I have used two lectures to cover formulas with tables. In the second lecture, structured referencing with Excel tables has been discussed. 
Circular Referencing: Then you will learn how to handle circular references with Excel formulas, how named cells and ranges work with formulas, and so on.
DATEDIF() and Date related Excel Functions: And I will finish this course with DATEDIF () and other Date related Excel functions!
I am assuring you that what you will learn in this crash course is priceless. I designed this course keeping in mind, to give you a solid base in Excel formulas and function. Thanks for watching. Enjoy the course!

Learn modern web development and convert a photoshop design to a responsive animated HTML5 and CSS3 website from scratch

4 NEW LECTURES ADDED ("What is 'Inspect Element' and When to Use It", "Showcasing Brand New PSD Design", "Creating the Layout Markup" and "Be the FIRST to know about new courses").
Make sure to check these at the bottom BONUS section as they contain important information.



Are you planning your web design career and looking for a good starting point? Or maybe you are a web development enthusiast looking to convert PSD designs into fully functional websites? Or just a beginner web developer/designer who is looking forward to learn how PSD and HTML5/CSS3 work together?

Either way, PSD to HTML5 conversion is a MUST-HAVE skill for any aspiring or experienced web developer/designer out there.

This PSD to HTML5 conversion course will take you from a complete beginner to a knowledgeable developer who is feeling comfortable converting PSD designs into fully functional and responsive HTML5 websites.

This is a lot more than PSD-to-HTML course. It is one of the most comprehensive web design/development courses out there as its very content-rich and features a lot of topics. We’ll start of with Photoshop and learn what are the basic starting steps of converting a PSD design into a HTML5 website. We will firstly understand and study the PSD design and after that slice it, cut it and collect the images. Then we’ll start coding our HTML5 markup to prepare the development of the website.

During the development stage, we'll learn a lot of things when styling our design: floats, positioning, width, custom columns, fluid design, full-width backgrounds AND MORE!!!

- We’ll be creating stunning animations FROM SCRATCH including an iPhone turn-on animation that looks very slick. We’ll use various famous libraries to create the remaining breathtaking animations on scroll and polish our website to the maximum. However, that’s not all.
We’ll then dive into creating our website responsive to fit any screen size and mobile device. We will be coding CUSTOM media queries to control the behavior of our website on smaller screens. I’ll be guiding you through a way to create a responsive navigation bar menu from scratch using basic programming techniques.

We’ll then jump into a brand new section that will get updated over time and which will include special tips and advanced techniques to convert problematic PSD designs into working websites.

In this course you will take a finished PSD design and learn how to convert it to create a fully responsive HTML5 page with pure CSS3 from SCRATCH. No responsive frameworks like Bootstrap! (My earlier course covers that!)

I believe that the only way to become a successful student of this course is through practice and involvement. That’s why you will be presented with quizzes and interactive questions throughout the course. After completing, you will be challenged to take a PSD design, use the skills that you’ve gained in this course and create a breathtaking HTML5 responsive website that you will be proud of!

How to make & name your ideas, techniques, and products FAR more valuable using “Magic” value-creating techniques!

Here’s a fact: Most things in life cannot be “transformed” into more valuable states very easily. They can’t be changed from one state to another… from one value to another.

But through branding. Oh, yes…branding.

Branding is one of the FEW things that can be make things FAR more valuable – with an amazingly small amount of time, effort, and energy.

The way a product/service/idea is presented makes all the difference.

The name that you give your product or service is the highest- leverage Marketing you can do.

Say something one way, and no one listens. Say it another way, and people will do anything, head for the voting booths, or take out their cash.

TTC Video - Oceanography: Exploring Earth's Final Wilderness
36xWEBRip | English | M4V + PDF Guidebook | 640 x 480 | AVC ~1500 kbps | 29.970 fps
AAC | 128 kbps | 44.1 KHz | 2 channels | 19:18:33 | 13.2 GB
Genre: eLearning Video / Nature and Fauna, Oceanology, Earth

Earth's ocean is a source of wonder, delight, sustenance, economic benefit, and awe in the face of its overwhelming mystery and power. It dominates the natural world in ways that scientists are only now beginning to understand. And although we call our home planet Earth, it would be more accurate to name it Ocean, since 71% of the globe is covered with water, and beneath the waves churn forces that make our world unique in the solar system:
Along mid-ocean ridges, lava flows from Earth's interior, forming new oceanic crust and driving the formation and movement of continents via the crucial process of plate tectonics.
The ocean's tremendous mass and thermal inertia serve as a climate control thermostat, moderating temperatures and making the planet habitable.
Life began in the ocean and was exclusively marine for billions of years; we owe our oxygen-rich atmosphere to the photosynthetic activity of oceanic organisms.

But for all its importance, the ocean hides its secrets, and it is only with the advent of new sounding and sampling techniques, satellite sensors, and deep sea submersibles that its riddles are being solved, shedding light on a domain that is breathtaking in its complexity and beauty.

Oceanography: Exploring Earth's Final Wilderness takes you on a scientific expedition to fathom the ocean's mysteries in 36 intensively illustrated half-hour lectures delivered by ocean scientist and Professor Harold J. Tobin of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, a researcher who has visited and mapped landscapes on the seabed that no human eyes had ever seen before.

Oceanography encompasses a wide range of fields, from biology and ecology, to geology, meteorology, chemistry, physics, and ocean engineering. No background in science is needed to follow these lectures, which provide a thorough appreciation for the ocean as a system that is arguably more intricate and fascinating than the continents, not least because it is a world that is fully three-dimensional, from the tidal zone to the deepest point on the ocean floor.

Piecing Together the Puzzle of the Ocean

Professor Tobin compares the exciting discoveries in oceanography in the past half-century to the exploration of a previously unknown planet. Scientists have been amazed again and again at what they've learned about the world beneath the waves. In these compelling lectures, you relive those discoveries, assembling the many pieces of the puzzle to gain a comprehensive picture of how the ocean works and how it affects the atmosphere, continents, and the web of life.

Among the discoveries you learn about are these:

New crust: Geologists once assumed that the ocean was a catch basin for sediments accumulating almost since Earth began. Instead, the seafloor is in a continual process of renewal and has the youngest rocks on the planet, far younger than rocks on land or even the water in the ocean itself.
Alien-like organisms: Biologists long believed that life could not exist at great depths. But not only does it exist, it flourishes in the utter darkness, cold, and high pressure of the deep sea in fantastic forms fit for a science fiction movie.
Living off Earth: Until recently, all life on Earth could be traced to photosynthetic processes drawing energy from the sun. But that was before the discovery of deep sea thermal vents, where organisms thrive on the primordial energy of the planet.
Rogue waves: Accounts of 100-foot-high "rogue" waves in the open ocean were long dismissed as physically impossible sailors' yarns. However, satellite and other measurements show that they occur and account for many ships that go missing.

Above all, you will learn to see the ocean as a single entity of striking complexity. Despite the names we have assigned to different regions of the ocean—Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic—they are all one continuous body of water, dominating the planet with features such as mid-ocean ridges that encircle the globe like the seams on a baseball.

A Story of Pure Exploration

The ocean is a huge subject, and you begin Oceanography by taking stock of the vast scope of the discipline. "This story is one of pure exploration," says Professor Tobin, and he approaches it by breaking the field down into its most important themes. First, he reviews the history of ocean exploration, before moving on to the topography of the seabed and how it is mapped. Diving deeper, he covers

the variety of habitats for ocean organisms;
the role of plate tectonics in creating and destroying the seafloor;
the origins of the ocean and life;
the sediments on the seabed and the conditions that produce oil and gas;
the reason that the sea is salty and why it isn't getting saltier.

Then he spends a lecture on water itself, investigating the special properties that make it indispensible to life. He continues with

the origins of waves and tides;
the diversity of marine life, from the ocean air to the deepest ocean trench;
the forces that shape coastlines;
the nature of bottom life, from tide pools to the deep sea;
and the links between weather, climate, and the ocean environment.

Professor Tobin closes the course with a glimpse into the future of the ocean and humanity's role in defining that destiny.

The Ocean in Your Life

Whether you live far from the coast or right on the water, the ocean touches on countless aspects of your life, from the climate to the oxygen-producing activity of ocean organisms to the many products that come to you by sea. The ocean's relevance also shows up in news stories about overfishing, ocean dumping, and other environmental issues, as well as in accounts of disasters such as the following, which Oceanography covers in detail:

Japanese tsunami: The devastating tsunami that engulfed coastal Japan in 2011 was set in motion by a gigantic undersea earthquake along a subduction zone, where the ocean floor is plunging beneath the rocks of the continent.
Gulf of Mexico oil spill: The Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 caused the largest uncontrolled release of oil and natural gas into the ocean ever recorded. You look at the expected—and unexpected—repercussions on marine life.
Hurricane Katrina: Unusually warm water in the Gulf of Mexico in the summer of 2005 turned an average hurricane into a category 5 monster. You investigate the ocean conditions that spawn hurricanes and the surprising power of their storm surges.
El Niño: Every few years the global climate enters a period of more extreme weather, when the Pacific trade winds slacken and the sea surface temperatures rise off the coast of Peru. You investigate the resulting cascade of effects, known as El Niño.

Enrich Your Understanding of the Ocean World

Oceanography is one of the most exciting areas in science, combining the thrill of exploring an otherworldly realm with the insights it gives into how the Earth works in all of its domains. Having spent nearly a year-and-a-half of his life cumulatively at sea on research expeditions, Professor Tobin is not only an expert on the subject but an eyewitness to the many wonders he describes.

After taking this course, says Professor Tobin, you will gain "an appreciation for the complexity and richness of the ocean environment"—a world of organisms that have evolved to live in every conceivable niche in the sea, of ceaseless volcanic activity that is hidden beneath miles of water, of tides and currents that girdle the globe, and of other fascinating phenomena that make the ocean the most dynamic part of the planet.

Next time you go to the beach, spend time on a sailboat, take a cruise, or even read a book or watch a movie or nature program about the sea, you will think of the expanse of blue water in a new way, with an enriched understanding of the ocean world.

Forget the idea that more is better when it comes to exercise. Now you can get the leanest, fittest body you’ve ever had by doing the opposite of what most “fitness experts” recommend. PACE Express is a doctor-designed fitness program created to give you maximum fat-loss by getting you out of the cardio “fat-burning zone” and into Progressive Dynamic Muscle Sequencing so you can ignite your “after burn” and burn fat for up to 24 hours after you stop moving. Even while you’re sleeping.
Every time you do a PACE Express workout, you’re progressively challenging your body so you can get maximum results. In fact, in the time it takes you to warm up with traditional cardio, you’re already done with your PACE Express workout for the day. PACE stands for progressive accelerated cardio exertion.

PACE Express creator, Dr. Al Sears, MD, spent over 20 years perfecting P.A.C.E. to give you maximum results in only 12 minutes a day. The secret behind P.A.C.E. is its one-of-a-kind accelerating progressivity that takes your fitness to the next level, regardless of your current fitness level.

Here's just part of what you are going to accomplish in the next six weeks:

Build the strength and power of your heart and lungs.
Reduce your risk of heart attacks and cardiovascular disease.
Enjoy deeper, more focused breathing.
Develop a powerful and disease-resistant immune system.
Dramatically increase your energy levels.
Increase your lean muscle mass.
Burn fat, even while you rest!

Insight for targeting tones, playing changes and blues guitar comping As anyone who squeaked through 10th grade history knows, the alchemists were a semi-scientific posse of medieval individuals utterly hung up on the notion of transforming lead into gold.
Of course, their efforts did not lead to economic good times, but Blues Alchemy addresses a much more useful and likely kind of transformation: turning those leaden, everyday blues licks and chord progressions into tasty and intriguing improvisational gold.

Blues Alchemy is about learning to play the changes, but not in the sense that jazz musicians do – it isn't about learning every arpeggio and mode under the sun. Instead, on ten diverse chord progressions, master blues alchemist David Hamburger will teach you how to transform your blues bag into gold by learning how to target tones and "play the changes." This series of video guitar lessons will have a dramatic impact on your blues guitar solos as you learn how to apply these principles.

Adopting a hands-on playing approach, Hamburger guides you through 10 distinct blues guitar rhythm pattern lessons with variations, 10 distinct solo lessons with variations, plus dozens of extra blues licks and tricks of the trade.

Genre: eLearning Video / Guitar lesson

Over the course of his 40-year recording and performing career, Robben Ford’s rhythm guitar work has excited the ears of his audience, fired up his musical collaborations with dozens of top artists and simply amazed his fellow guitar players. “Playing rhythm guitar is the greatest joy in my musical life,” says Robben, “I love the subject of rhythm guitar, I love talking about it and I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to finally present my rhythm guitar approaches in this Rhythm Revolution video course.”
Robben organized the Rhythm Revolution curriculum in two sections. In the first section, Robben presents brief top-line overviews of the rhythm guitar concepts and techniques that underpin his signature approach and style.

Robben summarizes concepts like single-note rhythms and fills, use of space and air, playing with a second guitar player, the importance of consistency, the art of simplicity, sonic qualities, essential right-hand techniques, chord vocabulary, harmonic approaches, dynamics and best ways to practice rhythm guitar. All of these topics are covered and demonstrated in much greater depth and detail in his Blues Revolution master course.

In the second section, Robben demonstrates all of his signature concepts and techniques across a series of 12 rhythm guitar studies. You’ll first learn the rhythm guitar parts as Robben performs them by studying his video performances, breakdowns, charts and tabs. You’ll then practice the parts by playing along with Robben until you’re ready to perform them yourself over the supplied rhythm tracks.

The twelve rhythm studies cover a wide variety of feels and grooves. You’ll work on an 8-bar blues with a bridge using a Freddie Green approach, an E minor rhythm groove from Tell Me I’m Your Man, a C minor blues, an 8-bar uptempo shuffle blues with a bridge in the key of A, a 12-bar D minor blues with a twist, a Bb funky blues focused on the use of sixths, a two-part vamp-like groove, a Hendrix-inspired rhythm part, an open jam in the key of F, a James Brown-ish funky blues groove, a chord progression from When I Leave Here and a John Lee Hooker-inspired Delta blues approach.

Robben demonstrates all of the parts over rhythm tracks that he recorded in the studio with a live rhythm section (band members Brian Allen on bass and Wes Little on drums!). Everything is tabbed and notated and all of the rhythm tracks are included for the student to work with on their own.

Robben also included three individual course reference eBooks; Master Tab and Notation (a compilation of all course tabs and notation), Rhythm Track Lead Sheets (lead sheets for all 12 of the rhythm tracks) and his own Chord Dictionary (features dozens of Robben’s favorite chord voicings).

Dizzying new technologies are putting unprecedented stress on America’s core constitutional values, as protections for privacy, property, and free speech are shrinking due to the wonders of modern life—from the Internet to digital imaging to artificial intelligence. It’s not hard to envision a day when websites such as Facebook, Google Maps, and Yahoo! introduce a feature that allows real-time tracking of anyone you want, based on face-recognition software and ubiquitous live video feeds.

This latest instructional DVD from Alan Gibson introduces the viewer to the basic structures, training methods and ideas of the Wing Chun system. All the exercises are fully explained to aid practice and understanding.
It includes training in the stance, stepping, punching, kicking, reflex training, entering and retreating, as well as Pak Sao, Lap Sao, Dan Chi Sao, Rolling Hands, Sticking Hands and Lat Sau Chung (the springy force of Wing Chun).

The perfect film for beginners or for curious martial artists from other styles.

The DVD takes you through the beginning levels of the Wing Chun Federation's curriculum. The Wing Chun Federation - formed in 1990 by Alan - maintains a non-political standpoint and is primarily concerned with the teaching of quality kung-fu. Its objective is to teach Wing Chun in a relaxed and accessible manner, where emphasis is placed on good technique and personal development rather than violence and aggression. Wing Chun can be simply learned by commitment and patience - age, sex or physical size are of no consequence, and a high level of proficiency can be obtained quickly and with ease.

Alan Gibson, has been training in the martial arts since 1980. He became a student of Wing Chun in 1984 after several years in GoJu Ryu Karate. He is a graduate of King Alfred’s University College, Winchester where he majored in Sports and Business Studies. Gibson learned his Wing Chun initially in his home town of Southampton, before traveling to Hong Kong to further his studies with Yip Chun. Since 1999 he has been a firm devotee of the “Wong Shun Leung Way” and is closely affiliated to David Peterson, principal instructor of the ‘Melbourne Chinese Martial Arts Club’ (MCMAC) in Australia.

Gibson is probably best known as the author of his popular instructional books including Beginning Wing Chun (formerly Why Wing Chun Works), Simple Thinking: Intelligent Fighters and The Wing Chun Forms: Combat Textbooks. These books are known internationally, with publishing rights being sold as far afield as Germany and Russia. He is also a freelance writer whose articles have appeared in many journals, including Combat, Martial Arts Illustrated, Ging Wing Chun, Kung-Fu Secrets, The Society Of Martial Arts and Loaded. Gibson is currently working on the continuing production of a comprehensive series of instructional DVDs and books .

Gibson has lectured for Southampton University on his Coaching Philosophy and is also well known on the seminar circuit. He is always happy to demonstrate his ideas and training methods to other groups (both Wing Chun and others) when invited to do so. He demonstrated at the First World Wing Chun Conference in Hong Kong in 1999. He continues to forge links with like-minded martial artists both in the UK and around the rest of the world.

Alan Gibson now trains in the Wong Shun Leung method of Wing Chun (Under David Peterson), which his books and DVDs reflect.

fxphd - Introduction to Golaem Crowd
English | October 2014 | mp4 | H264 1440x900 | AAC 2 ch | 1.98 GB 
eLearning | Course Number: GOL101 |

Golaem Crowd is an artist friendly crowd simulation tool for Maya used in production by a long and growing list of visual effect studios. With Golaem it’s easy to create diversity and apply behaviors to create natural looking crowds in a shorter time than has traditionally been possible. This introduction course assumes no previous knowledge of Golaem Crowd, but covers all aspects of the software and is based on direct production experience, so even existing users should find something new to learn.

After an overview of the software to give a sense of how the various tools work together, we’ll go through each element of Golaem Crowd in the order they’d be used to build a shot, from integrating custom Maya assets to crowd distribution, behaviors, simulation and rendering. While the course is pegged as introductory, it will quickly progress to cover more difficult subjects and more intermediate-level techniques.

Gareth Stevenson has been working as a 3D Generalist in London since switching over from the Videogame Industry, where he was at Microsoft. He’s worked on film projects including Hugo, Hunger Games and Star Trek: Into Darkness and TV series including Game of Thrones season 2 and 3. Most recently he’s been working with Golaem Crowd at Union Visual Effects in London, where he’s taken care of all 3D crowds on Davinci’s Demon’s Season 2, Stephen Frears’ Lance Armstrong Biopic and Suffragette.
course syllabus

Class 1
Overview and First Crowd Setup. We'll touch on each of the main tools as we go through the process of setting up a basic spectator crowd, from an empty scene to render. You'll get a feel for the overall crowd workflow and an understanding of how the different parts of Golaem work together.

Class 2
Character Maker - Skeleton Definition and Motion Conversion. We begin the conversion of Maya assets to custom Golaem Crowd formats by translating our Maya character skeleton into a Golaem Character Definition. We'll look at some of the animation editing tools, output a Golaem animation file and learn how to translate animation from one skeleton to another. Finally we'll take a look at a custom character set up for a crowd, a hybrid cyclist/bike skeleton.

Class 3
Character Definition and Asset Management. Continuing to set up our Maya assets, this week we'll look at how we use character geometry and materials in the crowd. We'll set up a custom character, learning how to switch between multiple pieces of geometry and materials on a single character type and some tricks we can use to create additional visual diversity.

Class 4
Entity Distribution/Placement. Now we have our crowd assets we can start to place them in an environment. We'll look at various techniques that allow us to do this, from the standard population tool to the paint tool and generating particles from an image.

Class 5
Behavior Editor - Tools + Motion and Geometry Behaviors. In this class we'll start to examine ways we can create behaviors for our crowd entities. We'll learn about the nodes we can use to build behavior trees such as logic operators, containers and stop/start triggers. We'll then take a look at the geometry behavior, demonstrating how to use a cached nCloth sim with our crowd.

Class 6
Behavior Editor - Character Locomotion. The locomotion behavior enables us to have walking crowd characters that use ground adaptation and dynamically switch animations. We'll set up a walking crowd and spend some time with related elements including navmesh creation, obstacles, goto and navigation behaviors.

Class 7
Behavior Editor - Additional Behaviors. We'll go through some additional behaviors and settings that can be used with our crowd characters, such as 'constraint', 'formation' and 'look at' behaviors. We'll also take a look at the flocking behavior that can be used for groups of birds and other flying creatures.

Class 8
Simulation and Rendering. Taking a break from the behavior editor, we'll go through the process of simulating and rendering our crowd. We'll look at ways we can manipulate our sim to improve our final result and various settings that may be useful.

Class 9
Behavior Editor - Physics. Back into the Behavior Editor one last time to show how we can integrate ragdoll physics and forces with our crowd characters. We'll set up a scene with guys falling over obstacles, falling over each other, rolling down a slope and getting thrown onto the ground by an explosion. We'll see various techniques we can use to achieve effects like these and how to deal with the issues that arise.

Class 10
Production Tips and Tricks. We'll look at some useful techniques across several areas of Golaem, including ways to iterate more quickly on your simulation, making global changes to all crowd fields, how to create greater visual diversity from just one texture, quickly editing animation files and how to set up avoidance for non-crowd animated elements in your scene.

An Effective Approach to Tackling Textbook Problems to Stop Struggling and Really Start Learning

This method works! I’ve tested it for over 10 years of teaching Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Once the students get the hang of this method, their Physics, Math and other STEM classes become much, much less of a challenge, so they can concentrate on solid learning.



Why should you take this course?

Because when it comes to textbook problem solving, you probably were wrongly taught to mimic your teachers.

Can you always produce the answer to the problems that are presented to you?
While solving a textbook problem on your own, have you gotten to the point where you don't know what to do next?
In class, have you found yourself asking “How did the teacher come up with that step?” or “How did the teacher know we had to use that equation?” or “How was I supposed to know that?” ?

Auto-renewable Subscriptions, Non-renewable Subscriptions, Consumables, Non-consumables & Virtual Currencies Demystified

Apples Subscription-based Pricing is a Game-changer! And YOU can benefit from it.

Subscription-based Pricing is a HUGE deal! Till recently it was limited to only a few categories, but yet again Apple will shake the App Industry by allowing any apps to use the subscription business model. You should use it immediately!

Okay, but implementing In-app Purchases can be a huge pain. And now that Swift 3 is out there are no real tutorials, wrappers or solutions out there. This is why I have created RebeloperStore, a powerful In-app Purchases Helper that will help you add any kind of IAP with just a fraction of the time and effort it usually takes.

With RebeloperStore you will be able to add in-app purchases to your app with ONE LINE OF CODE. Here's the code you need to add to buy an auto-renewable subscription with RebeloperStore:

RebeloperStore.shared.purchaseRenewable(.autoRenewableSubscription1)

And here's how you can check if an auto-renewable subscription has expired or not:

RebeloperStore.shared.verifyNonRenewablePurchase(.nonRenewableSubscription1) { (result, resultString) in if result { // Content Unlocked } }

It's just too easy!

RebeloperStore supports all In-app purchase types:

consumables
non-consumables
auto-renewable subscriptions
non-renewable subscriptions
All of them have the same one-line approach!

And the best part is that it is written in Swift 3! You can rest assured that it will compile with the latest version of Swift.

But the fun doesn't stop there. As a BONUS I have included a Virtual Currency System right into RebeloperStore so you may handle coins, gems, coin-packs, swords, bombs and helmets with ease! Here's how to buy 50 gems (secondary Virtual Currency) with 70 coins (primary Virtual Currency):

RebeloperStore.shared.purchaseVirtualCurrency(50, ofVirtualCurrencyType: .secondaryVirtualCurrency, forPayableVirtualCurrencyAmount: 70, ofPayableVirtualCurrencyType: .primaryVirtualCurrency)

You may add as many Virtual Currencies as you like!

How awesome is that! And the features don't end here. RebeloperStore is truly all you need to add any kind of In-app Purchase into your app. RebeloperStore is the ultimate In-app Purchase helper.

Besides all these cool features, the reason why I truly love RebeloperStore is the reason I've started this description: auto-renewable subscriptions. 

In our opinion here at Rebeloper Subscription-based Pricing has been the Announcement of the Year! But before we dive into the details let’s talk about the current status of the App Industry. Free to Play rules everything. While this is a good way of earning money from apps it had some serious side effects on the developer community. The problem with Free to Play is that it cannot work for all kind of apps. It really works mainly on games and it mainly works only when implemented on a complicated and huge scale.

Free to Play was eating up the Middle Class of the developer community. It seemed that nothing will save us and we’ll be pushed out by the giants of the elite 1%. But the going for the subscription business model may give us a second chance. I personally have been waiting for this day for years. Why? Because the Subscription Based Business Model is the Holy Grail of Cash Flow.

The only one problem with subscriptions was that people didn’t necessarily wanted to subscribe to services or apps. Now that Apple is taking this model to the masses by introducing it on the App Store, we will see a massive adoption rate among users. It will no longer be weird to subscribe and pay each and every month. This time it will be something normal.

There are just over 2 hours of video in this training, recorded live as I build a lead generating web site, with Wordpress, from scratch. The whole process took me 2 hours and I show you everything I did on video. This is so simple your granny could follow along, so no worries if you don't have a computer degree. Plus you can always drop me a mail at any time for help and advice.

Given that this is your first time and given that I had some ideas of what I was going to put on the web site in advance, this should take you a couple of days thinking time and no more than a day to put the site together.

The point is, that you can do this in under a week, giving you a solid 23 days to see if it is possible to generate leads with this concept. By which time, if you have not managed to generate a lead, then just claim your full refund from Udemy – your guarantee is backed by their world class customer satisfaction system, so you have nothing to worry about and nothing to lose.

However, chances are this will work for you as it has worked for thousands of other businesses all over the world, generating sales leads out of "thin air" like a magic sales leads machine, the business gift that just keeps giving!

Designed with the first-time mechanic in mind, this educational video will leave nothing unexplained as you follow our engines through every technique required to remove the engine from the chassis and completely disassemble every engine component. You'll follow every part through the machine shop to see what goes on behind closed doors in order to return your parts to a "factory fresh" status.

The DVD takes you through the critical pre-assembly checking process to ensure proper clearances and operation. The final assembly is the most detailed section of the video, where you'll see every method for proper sealing, torquing, and assembly of your refreshed or new components.

All the apropriate theories and techniques such as firing-order and ignition wiring are explained, followed by tips on installing your engine back in the chassis as well as the start-up and break-in procedures required for any engine type.

Most importantly, you'll see every tool required, being used. Once you see how to operate a particular tool or you see an engine theory explained, you'll have that knowlege forever. This DVD is designed to give you a positive understanding of all the basic engine building techniques and concepts, and then actually show you every step of the application of those techniques.

Genre: eLearning Video / History

Nothing changes the world as quickly and inexorably as war. In warfare, the future course of entire civilizations, regions, and continents can be determined in as little as a few hours.
Throughout history, specific individual battles have turned the tide of historical events, triggering changes that have given us the world we know:

The 7th-century battle of Badr transformed the prophet Mohammad into a major political force, establishing Islam firmly as a legitimate religion that could not be suppressed.

The 1066 Battle of Hastings impacted world history by creating a new fusion of peoples and cultures in England and orienting the country permanently toward Europe.

The 1759 Battle of Quebec determined the future of North America, shifting power such that the English language and British culture would predominate.

In addition to causing changes on a global scale, military engagements have often produced monumental effects within individual cultures:

The outcome of the 4th-century battle of the Frigidus River established Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire.

The 16th-century battles of Panipat established Mughal domination over the Indian subcontinent that would last for centuries.

In 1836, a battle that lasted a mere 18 minutes resulted in the U.S. acquisition of nearly one-third of its continental land mass.

In these battles and many others, if it were not for the particular outcome that transpired, history might have turned out very differently. As such, looking closely at military engagements provides a vital key to historical causation—showing us how and why events unfolded and civilizations developed as they have. 

A penetrating look at military conflicts also acts as a corrective, allowing for a more accurate view of major events and the forces underlying them. As a case in point, the Battle of Waterloo is commonly thought of as the downfall of Napoleon; yet his losses at the earlier Battle of Leipzig unquestionably doomed his ambitions and were the true marker and determinant of his fall. Similarly, a 1939 battle in Mongolia that is all but forgotten played an extremely significant role in both the outbreak and the outcome of World War II.

For these reasons and more, the study of pivotal battles is a highly revealing analytical tool and a key component for understanding world history. Offering eye-opening insights into humanity’s past, a knowledge of mankind’s most critical military engagements enriches and deepens any view into civilizations and their evolution. 

In the dynamic lectures of The Decisive Battles of World History, Professor Gregory S. Aldrete of the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay guides you in a discovery of the military conflicts that have had the greatest impact in shifting the direction of historical events and shaping our world. Covering nearly 4,000 years of history, this course explores more than three dozen history-making military engagements, from the landmark battles of the Western world to their counterparts across Asia, India, and the Middle East. These 36 lectures feature vital historical background, vivid accounts of the campaigns themselves, and a thorough look at their influence on the unfolding of history.

Military Encounters that Changed the World 

In a grand tour of the battlefields of history, you’ll relive extraordinary conflicts such as these:

Actium, 31 B.C.: Witness the drama of this massive naval battle, played out against the tragic love affair of Antony and Cleopatra. Actium marked the birth of the Roman Empire and its centuries-long domination of the Western world.

Yarmouk and al-Qadisiyyah, 636: Follow the exploits of the Islamic Rashidun armies as they vanquish the Byzantine and Sassanid forces in two milestone battles, establishing the religious and linguistic orientation of the Middle East that persists to this day.

Tenochtitlán, 1521: A pivotal event in global history; learn about the astounding defeat of the powerful Aztec Empire by fewer than 1,000 Spaniards, which set the model for the era of European colonization that would transform the world.

Sekigahara, 1600: In this huge confrontation of the samurai era involving 160,000 combatants, study the political intrigue and battlefield events that forged the nation of Japan, inaugurating a lineage of shoguns that would rule until the modern era.

Trenton, 1776: Trace the daring maneuvers undertaken by George Washington at the darkest hour of the American Revolution to outwit the British and save the revolutionary movement, events that were essential in turning the tide of the war and bringing the United States into being.

Trafalgar, 1805: Envision the British naval forces under Admiral Horatio Nelson as they face Napoleon’s combined fleets in the greatest battle of the age, and the titanic engagement that marked the beginning of Napoleon’s decline.

Complex Causes, Galvanizing Effects

As a central and outstanding feature of these lectures, you’ll look in depth at layers of causation in the evolution of civilizations, as well as in the conflicts between cultures and nations. For example, you learn that the consequence of the Greek victory over the Persians at Plataea in 479 B.C. was Greek independence and freedom, which allowed for the era we know as the cultural Golden Age of Greece. A Persian victory at Plataea might have left us without the ideas of Socrates and Plato or the scientific thought of Aristotle, which achieved their influence on Western civilization through the spread of Greek culture that resulted from Alexander’s victory at Gaugamela in 331 B.C. 

The Science and Art of Warfare 

Through detailed study of the campaigns themselves, you’ll grasp how the historic outcomes of the battles were achieved militarily. In doing so, you’ll learn about military systems, from the war chariots of ancient Egypt and the Roman “manipular” armies to the battle tactics of the Mongols, the siege warfare of the Ottoman Turks, the armies of the Napoleonic wars, and the tank combat of World War II. You’ll witness the evolution of naval technology, from the ancient triremes of Actium to the galleys of the Renaissance, and from the Age of Sail’s mammoth “ships of the line” to the battleships and aircraft carriers of the modern era. 

Throughout this inquiry, you’ll assess the achievements of history’s most outstanding military commanders. In addition to learning about iconic leaders such as Alexander and William the Conqueror, you’ll encounter numerous other extraordinary figures who left their mark on these dramatic events, such as

Saladin, the legendary Islamic general who routed the Christian Crusaders at Hattin;

Admiral Yi Sun-shin, one of the greatest naval commanders of all time, who almost single-handedly repelled two invasions of Korea;

Simón Bolívar, the dynamic revolutionary who played a leading role in the campaigns to end Spanish rule in Latin America; and

Helmuth von Moltke, the brilliant military strategist and organizational genius who commanded the Prussian forces at Königgrätz in 1866, forging a united Germany.

Epic and Multidimensional Human Drama

Through his powerfully evocative words, aided by specially made maps and animations of the engagements, Professor Aldrete brings the battlefield events alive with gripping vividness, taking you blow-by-blow through the unfolding of each conflict. Throughout the lectures, he reveals rich historical background material that highlights the high drama, poignancy, and scope of the human experience of war.

You’ll learn about the royal intrigue underlying the medieval battle of Tannenberg and the 1571 “Holy League” of European nations formed to confront the Ottoman juggernaut, and you’ll contemplate the larger-than-life personalities of Sam Houston and Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who clashed in the battle for Texas’s independence from Mexico.

In the heat of battle at Sacheon (1592), you’ll encounter the monstrous, armored “Turtle Ships” of the Korean navy, surmounted with great dragons’ heads spewing smoke and flames— among the most ingenious and fearsome weaponry ever devised. You’ll learn how, in the 1709 battle of Poltava, the fate of two empires hinged on a freak musket shot that wounded a king’s foot, and how four crucial minutes in the 1942 battle of Midway permanently shifted the balance of power in the Pacific from Japan to the United States.

In The Decisive Battles of World History, you’ll trace the critical pivot points where key military engagements determined the course history has taken. This enthralling learning experience provides far-reaching insights into the story of world cultures by revealing the foundational impact of military battles in human affairs.

Nineteen-time Grammy nominee and four-time Grammy winner, Larry Carlton is perhaps the most versatile and accomplished guitarist walking the planet to day. With over 3,000 sessions, 200 hit records and 100 gold albums to his credit, Carlton has his fingerprints indelibly imprinted on virtually every genre of music.
Mr. 335 also plays the blues like nobody's business. Better yet, Larry possesses an extraordinary ability to brilliantly communicate both the art and science of blues guitar. 335 Blues, Larry's first course in twenty years, imparts Carlton's philosophical, technical and musical approach in a genre rich with expression and improvisation - the blues.

335 Blues is a hands-on, playing course. No tedious theory or exercises here. You'll be playing something new and majorly cool within fifteen minutes of digging in. But, put your time in and 335 Blues will likely remodel your entire approach to and understanding of blues guitar.

Larry presents 335 Blues in three main sections. First up, you'll play your way through a series of blues grooves in a variety of feels, keys and tempos. For each groove, Carlton demonstrates three choruses worth of comping and three choruses of improvisational soloing. Each performance is followed by an explanation of what he played and more importantly, why he played it. Then it's your turn. Use the video, charts, tab, notation and practice rhythm tracks to make the material your own. TrueFire's player controls make working with the curriculum a breeze.

Carlton drills down on essential techniques and improvisational approaches in the next section. Bending and vibrato (in fact, four types of vibrato) are demonstrated and broken down in unprecedented detail. Use of motifs, space and phrasing are likewise presented in an amazing, ear-opening fashion. Other gems of insight in this section include use of the melodic minor in blues, "knuckle voicings" and recommendations for how to approach both practice and playing.

The third section covers a wide variety of topics ranging from the technical to the philosophical. Tone and how to go about tweaking your equipment to achieve it, is presented comprehensively. Insight on recording, jamming and performing with other musicians is likewise addressed. A few anecdotes and even a little show and tell on the Steely Dan studio rig make this section one you'll likely watch over and over again.

"If you love electric blues guitar, then 335 Blues may be a dream come true for you, " says Jude Gold of Guitar Player Magazine. All in all, 335 Blues raises the bar on blues instruction with its innovative approach, articulate presentation and enough tasty moves to last a lifetime.

From there we'll also examine and adjust a texture that we plan to clone onto our photo to create the illusion of molten cracked skin. Finally, we'll finish by painting in some final details with our brush tool and make our image pop by adjusting it with an adjustment layer. By utilizing the methods and techniques in this course, you'll be able to push your own photo manipulation projects involving fire to a whole new creative level while having a lot of fun.

You want to BE THE BEST BA YOU CAN POSSIBLY BE. However, you face a number of problems to meet your own expectations:

PROBLEMS : There could be a gap between your own expectations of yourself versus how others see you. This gap could be due to lack of core skills, mismatch between your title and actual work done or inability to meet high expectations from others.

Self help will give instant results to build core skills and progress without waiting for feedback or appraisals. You will get instant answers and solutions to your problems to guide yourself. 

If you are a Business Analyst, you can:

Identify your role clearly and assess the work you need to do to reach full potential in the role.
Identify signs of problems and signs of success in your day-to-day work.
Identify root causes for problems, fix them and move ahead in your career. 
If you are a Leader of Business Analysts, you can:

Java Socket Programming: Build a Chat Application
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 2 Hours | Lec: 25 | 235 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn Java socket programming concepts and build a multi-user chat application

Socket programming is used for developing client-server applications in Java. In client-server architecture, the server provides some service and the client can use this service to get the desired output or result. Sockets also allow two or more computers to communicate with each other over the network using TCP/IP protocol.

This course is for anyone who has basic knowledge about core Java concepts and who is totally new to Java socket programming. This course may not be suitable for students/programmers who are not familiar with Java.

This course is going to teach you how to write client-server applications in Java using socket programming. It will also teach you how to write a multi-user/group chat application in Java with chat logging functionality. All the concepts are explained in a very simple language. This course is highly practical-based with a very few power-point presentations. Apart from socket programming, this course also gives you a short introduction to some of the Java concepts which are required for understanding our chat application. This chat application will give you a concrete understanding of all socket programming fundamentals.

And finally, a chat application could be a good topic for your school/college mini-project. It is also an area which is quite unique to work on rather than regular Java projects. As it’s a short course, it wont be boring at all. You need to invest only around 2 hours of your time.

I believe you will enjoy this course and learn a lot. Happy Coding :)

Learn complete CSS Basic Fundamentals from scratch

Note: Introductory Price, Price will hike soon once more content is added, so join now and get the benefit.

In this tutorial you will learn complete CSS from scratch with best examples to understand the concepts better.

CSS Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.

CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Facets are flat faces on geometric shapes. The organization of naturally occurring facets was key to early developments in crystallography, since they reflect the underlying symmetry of the crystal structure. Gemstones commonly have facets cut into them in order to improve their appearance by allowing them to reflect light.

DCT-MP, BP, and LS: 20 DVDs That teach Filmmaking from Writing to Post. All DVDs feature: Motion Menus and Instant-Access Chapter buttons. The most revolutionary training course you will ever own. Over 30 hours of filmmaking savvy, wisdom, examples, demonstrations, tips and tricks, presented on 20 DVDs by people who work in Hollywood day in, day out. Learn Scriptwriting, Formatting, Editing, Camera Operation, Lighting, Exposure, Audio, and Directing, all focused on Digital Movies. DCT-BP (Basic Production): 10-Point lighting, the jargon and motive behind each light source, as well as balancing them together with Quality, Quantity, Direction, and Color. Composition concepts: Law of Thirds, Screen Mass, Triangular Dominance, Color Harmony, and Planar Separation, as well as the psychological impact of each. Also, Lenses, Depth of Field, Shots, Axes of Motion, Makeup, and Steadicam. DCT-MP (Movie Production): Screenwriting, Directing, Acting. Add foreground detail and make a dolly move really count, block your actors to match their eyelines, compose your shots to set the audience at ease (or not), and light the set with a minimum of fixtures. DCT-LS (Lighting Set): 10 complete sections devoted to Pro lighting. Matching your lighting to fire-light, Christmas lights, uncorrected fluorescents, flashlights, candles, lighting chrome weapons, and groups of actors at a card table scene. When you finish the last DVD of this series, your mind will be overloaded. You will never watch movies the same way again, knowing that the "Natural Sunset" light inside an apartment is actually tungsten light off a gold reflector, and that there is a reason why directors move the actors in specific axes.

The Digital Cinema Course begins by detailed instructions on building a screenplay with proper structure and solid characters. Many screen writing textbooks have also done this, but the course is the first to do it by use of a dramatic short film teaching writers the basics of overcoming obstacles and disasters. This is then furthered by second more concise section outlining how to write in clear instructions. It categorizes specific methods and tools, and inspires writers who may have given up on dramatic storytelling. The following section describes how to physically construct a screenplay, what paper to use, how to bind it, and how to format the content. This is done with the use of computer graphics. Once the storytelling sections are complete, the course moves on to teach film editing. Starting with the history of editing and progressing to current digital nonlinear editing, the section prepares the filmmaker for the field. It abides by the rule that the best cinematographer or director is first a competent editor. After the editing section, the course moves on to discuss filmmaking equipment and gear, from the basic C-stand to the intricate use of color gels and corrective filtration. It prepares filmmakers for the technical aspect of making movies with HMI, tungsten, and fluorescent lighting. After the equipment section, it explores basic production in a controlled studio environment. Lighting, lenses, shots, depth of field, composition, and axes of movement. The course then applies all the concepts learned in the movie production section. By far the longest of the sections, at about 12 hours, it puts all the principles to the test on a real movie set. It carries with it all the variables that can assault filmmakers while trying to make a digital film. After the movie production section has been completed, the course moves on to the advanced lighting section. This is the most detailed of the sections, concentrating for hours on the art of lighting a film set with faith to the script's intention. Whether lighting to mimic candlelight, firelight, or fluorescent warehouse lighting, this section discusses the most difficult situations that a cinematographer may confront. The Digital Cinema Course is also accompanied by a color technical manual for the field, a checklist, and a preparation CD.


DCT-GG Gear Guide (8 DVDs) Components:

DCT-FF: Focuses on Follow Focus Devices with Karl Horn from Cinetech. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-FF volume teaches Focus Pulling Techniques, Follow Focus Types, Single/Double Wheel, Whips and Extensions, Speed Cranks, Rear-Firing Configs and much more. The more you shoot with your Pro HD or SD Digital Cinema Camera, the more you will rely on the focusing dial to create more dramatic transitions into actors or objects. The more you focus with your camera dial, the more you will feel that your wrist is not in the correct ergonomic position to achieve the best focus pulls. That's where follow focus wheels come in. They reorient the direction of the focus dial to one that more easily fits the movement of the human body. Also, they give you focus stops, so that you don't have to guess where your subject is. Just set up the A and B stops, and go from A to B. No guess work. This comes in very handy in cameras that do not have numerical readouts for focus marks. Another very useful facet of focus pulling devices, is their ability to allow attachment of whips or extensions. This allows you to "pull" focus from behind the camera, more comfortably. It also allows another professional, the "focus puller" to pull focus for you, so that you can just concentrate on panning and tilting the camera with the actor. The DCT-FF DVD will teach you all that, and much more.

DCT-FLUO: Focuses on Fluoresecents with Frieder Hocheim and Tom Jacob from KinoFlo. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-FLUO volume teaches Fluorescent Fixtures, Large Studio Models, Small Portable Models, Diffusion Techniques, Dimming, DMX Controls, Daylight/Interior Bulbs, Special Effects, 12V Car Models and much more. The more your lighting experience increases, the more likely you will rely on Fluorescent lighting. It is perfectly tungsten or daylight balanced, soft, emits almost no heat, and is dimmable with very little shift in color temperature. However, the subject of fluorescent lighting is very complicated. Which instruments do you use? Which color temperature? Do you match with the window or the other tungsten instruments? How do you perform DMX dimming and networking? How do you safely replace bulbs? What color options are there? How do you safely regulate power output of the DC supplies? All these questions plus many more are answered in the DCT-FLUO DVD. 

DCT-GELS: Focuses on Gels and Lighting Modifiers with Joel Svendsen from Rosco Gels. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-GELS volume teaches Correction Gels, Film vs. Video Intensities, Color Effect Gels, Modifiers for Stage Lights, Daylight Balance Gels, Tungsten Balance Gels and much more. The more your lighting experience increases, the more likely you will rely on color gels for correcting instruments or creating a mood. However, the subject of gels is very complicated. Which type of gel do you use? How much color temperature correction is necessary? Do you match an HMI instrument with the window or the other tungsten instruments? How does gelling an instrument differ from Digital HD to Film? How do you safely use gels? What options are there in color and and mood? Both Straw and Amber gels cause a mathematical warming shift in the color temperature, so why are there two different types? All these questions plus many more are answered in the DCT-GELS DVD.

DCT-GRDR: Focuses on Gear Rental with Steve Tobenkin from Birns & Sawyer in Hollywood. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-GELS volume teaches Safe Renting Practices, Rental Contracts, Insurance Types, Negotiating Travel Days, 3-Day Weeks, Building Relationships, Trust and Credit, Economies of Scale and much more. As your reputation improves in your filmmaking circle, you will be called upon to shoot bigger and bigger jobs. It would not make sense to own 4 different cameras when you primarily use just one, especially when the other cameras are used only once or twice a year, or cost $120,000. Enter the rental house. You can get a great camera package, lights, grip gear, and stay within budget. The entire rental is tax deductible as an expense, as opposed to amortizing an expensive camera package for 7 years. You don't have to take out a loan for it. Just get a down payment from the production company, rent the gear, use it, then return it. Makes sense, sounds easy. It's not. It is a very complicated process that sometimes takes several disasters to fully respect. You can avert most disasters by carefully viewing the DCT-GR Gear Rental DVD. Mr. Tobenkin teaches you all the ins and outs of safely renting gear, as well as avoiding common horrors of discovering that "mysterious disappearances" are not covered by insurance companies, and can leave you penniless for years. For over an hour, he guides you through every line of a common rental contract, explains every term, and gives you real street-advice every step of the way. Rent safely with the DCT-GR volume, also included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course.

DCT-GRIP: Focuses on Grip Gear with Ed Phillips from MSE (Matthews Studio Equipment). This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-GRIP volume teaches C-Stands, Light Stands, Combo Stands, Flags, Black Net, Silks and Diffusers, Cucaloris Modifiers, Cutters, Dots and Fingers and much more. The more your production experience increases, the more likely you will rely on professional grip equipment. Also, your ability to identify and use grip gear on the set will earn the respect of your peers and employers. Pro gear lasts longer, looks more professional, holds weight more securely, and helps you sculpt precision-lit sets with flags and scrim. Which light stands do you use? Which clamps for which lights? How do you safely equip, mount, and weight-balance a C-stand? How do cheaply made roller stands differ from professional ones? What is the difference between a preemie, a HiHi, and a combo stand? What is the difference between a half-apple and a pancake? All these questions plus many more are answered in the DCT-GRIP DVD.

DCT-HDL: Focuses on Heavy Dollies with 35-year Veteran Hollywood Key Grip Chet Spinney. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-HDL volume teaches Heavy Studio Dollies, Balancing Dolly Track, Proper Dollying Methods, Dolly & Jib Moves, Pro Mic Booms and much more. You can get away with using compact dollies on many occasions, but there are certain situations where you will be required to help set up or operate a heavy dolly. Mr. Spinney will help you understand the principles of balancing a dolly track, pushing techniques, proper movement, and braking. After that, Mr. Steve Schuneman will share his extensive experience operating Pro Mic Booms on multi-million dollar TV shows. He will show you how to operate a pro mic boom, or communicate with your boom operator so that you can have a more productive set experience. As a filmmaker, you should be familiar with the operation and terminology, facets and limitations, of every piece of equipment on the set. This DVD will help get you one step farther, in a generally ignored part of the industry that doesn't get the glitz of body-mounted camera systems, but has been a mainstay of every indie and studio film for 60 years.

DCT-LENS: Focuses on Diopters, Converters, and Filters with Bill Turner from Schneider Optics. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-LENS volume teaches Diopters, Wide and TeleConverters, Adapters, 4x4 Filters Polarizers, Graduated ND Filters, Color Filters and much more. The more you work with your fixed-lens camera, the more you will want to modify the optics of that lens beyond its capability. You will want a wider wide angle, and a deeper telephoto. The only way of achieving that is with the use of Wide Angle Adapters and Converters, as well as Telephoto Converters. Learn the difference between a converter, an adapter, and a diopter. Learn how to film just one part of the face, like just the lips or the eyes. Learn how to select the correct attachment for your camera, and get the most out of it. Learn how to make a penny fill the frame. Also, learn how to protect your camera from misuse of large converters. After that, jump into filters. Learn how to darken a bright sky to get it within the dynamic range of HDV, but not affect the rest of the scene, how to see through reflections, how to darken the overall scene to allow a wider aperture for shallower depth of field. All these subjects and many more are covered in the DCT-LENS DVD.

DCT-MB: Focuses on Matteboxes & Zoom Controllers with James Lee from 16x9inc. (Chrosziel and Bebob). This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-MB volume teaches Mounting Matteboxes, Using French Flags, Side Flags, Baseplates and Rods, Sunshades, Filter Holders, Camera Design Issues, Zoom Controllers, Electronic Focus and much more. How do they achieve that crisp, contrasty look in films, even when shooting into the sun? Why is it that when you try it, the shot is milky or hazy? The mattebox is the device that solves that problem. It's great shooting into the sun: You get great highlights everywhere, the actors are naturally backlit, the sun isn't in their eyes, and the scene looks more dynamic. But you need protection for the camera lens from haze and the major culprit, flare. Matteboxes allow you to control flare like never before. They also allow you to mount 4x4 and sometimes 4x5.65 filters demonstrated in the DCT-LENS DVD. They also shade your wide angle lens adapters which may or may not come with their own lens hoods. After that, learn all about the essential zoom controller. Even if you never zoom in the shot (as any pro filmmaker would) you need a zoom controller to easily change the focal length of your lens without moving your hand away from the pan handle. If you need to zoom for say, an industrial or how-to video, or for effect, the zoom controller is indispensable for providing a smooth focal length change without unnecessary jitter on the camera body. Learn all about electronic zoom and focus controllers in the DCT-MB DVD.

DCT-ONCM: Focuses on Pedestals, Jibs, and Camera Lights with David Butler from Ste-Man (Cartoni and PAG). This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-ONCM volume teaches Studio Pedestals, Compact Jibs, On-Camera Lights, Dichroic Filters, Diffusing Eye-Lights, 3-Wheel Dollies, Battery Chemistry, Underwater Bags and much more. You already have a dolly that will get you closer to your subject in a more dynamic smooth manner. But what happens when you need to rise up with the actor as he gets out of a chair or a car, or goes up the stairs? To maintain a smooth movement akin to a dolly, but in a vertical direction, you need a jib. Enter the DCT-ONCM DVD. Learn how to use jibs, their axes of motion, and techniques. This DVD goes much further, and explains the usage of on-camera lights. You are in a situation where the interior illumination is too low for your camera to see the subject, and it is beyond your control to raise the ambient light level or bring in a studio light. You need the battery operated camera light. Learn how to use them and all the accessories, as well as the battery systems and chemistries that match them. You are opening a new studio, and you don't want to simply use a tripod on wheels. You want the ease of use and heavy weight of a studio pedestal with a vertical pneumatic lift. Learn how to use them, bleed excess pressure, maneuver and operate them. You have a shot that requires a camera to be inserted underwater, or in a situation where it may be splashed by waves from below. You need an underwater bag, and this DVD shows you how to use the most trusted and popular types. You want a body-mounted camera support that offers you full range of motion, but you don't need a full steadicam or can't afford one. This DVD shows you how to mount and operate the popular PAG Orbitor body mounted system.

DCT-PODS: Focuses on Tripods, Bags, and Reflectors with Mark Bender from Bogen Imaging. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-PODS volume teaches Light Duty Tripods, Medium Duty Tripods, Heavy Capacity Tripods, Camera Bags, Reflectors and much more. The more you use your pro camera, the more you find that it deserves a better ride than a Sears tool bag. Enter pro camera bags, specifically designed to safely and lightly carry cameras and accessories. Learn to pick the right type, and how to make it work for the projects you are involved in. Also, learn how to setup and operate light and heavy tripods, the difference between friction and fluid heads, and what capacity is required of a tripod to do the job. An added bonus is a section on reflector types, what uses they have, and how to get the most out of them.

DCT-TGHM: Focuses on Tungsten and H.M.I Fresnels, with John Gresch from Arri Lighting. This DVD is already included in the DCT-MP/COMMAND Course. However if only specialized instruction is needed, the DCT-TGHM volume teaches Tungsten Fresnels, HMI Fresnels, Changing Lenses, Changing Bulbs, Attaching Softboxes, Using Snoots, Safety, Spotting/Flooding and much more. Just as important as selecting the correct camera and mic, is selecting the proper light kit. The more experienced you become, the less you'll be willing to settle for "natural" overhead fluorescent lights, with blown out highlights, a green cast, and deep shadows under the actors' eyes. You will want to sculpt your frame, light the actors properly and dramatically, and throw shadows on parts of the background that you don't like. You will need a professional fresnel light kit, and this DVD will show you how to use it. It will go into great detail, from the moment you take the lights out of the box, to tearing down the softbox attachment and packing the kit away. The DCT-TGHM is the right DVD for those filmmakers wanting to get more out of their light kits. The information contained is mostly general, and applies to many other lighting systems.

Bass players lay down the foundation in practically every style of music by bridging the gap between the strict rhythm of percussion instruments and the melodic domain of lead instruments and vocals. Today's bassists must not only lock-in with the drummer to serve up the all-important "groove" but are now also called on to step up front and treat the audience to a searing and melodic solo from time to time.
Bass players are in high demand and can easily find gigs, making the instrument attractive for aspiring musicians. But once you decide to play bass, you still face the question of where to begin and that's what Bass Basics is all about.

Bass Basics starts at the very beginning, teaching you journeyman-level bass chores such as the proper way to change and tune strings. You will learn the instrument's individual parts as well as what to look for when shopping for a new bass - Stu even gives you a guided tour of his latest Fender signature Urge Bass II! He shares tips on tone settings for both the bass and amplifier and how to use these controls to get the sound you want.

In this volume of video bass guitar lessons Stu demonstrates the essential left and right hand techniques developed to build strength and endurance. He teaches you the language of music to help make quick work communicating ideas at jams and auditions. Bass Basics equips you with a solid foundation of techniques, theory, rhythm patterns and bass lines, all of which can applied in any style of music. Stu even shows you how to read tab and follow a chart as well as teach you the essential theory required to take your playing in any direction you choose.

Never before has a bassist of this caliber shared such vast knowledge in such a comprehensible and accessible way. If you're serious about learning the bass and want to enjoy the journey, let Bass Basics be your guide. You won't go astray!

Guitar Lab's innovative learning systems employ a hands-on approach where students "play" their way through the curriculum using learning tools such as POP video, practice rhythm tracks, and interactive tab and notation, which allows the student to play along with the tab and notation, at any tempo, without change in pitch.
Acoustic blues guitar relies as much on stock techniques, grooves and licks as it does on creative improvisation and personal interpretation. And this is exactly how Dalton presents the material; he'll first show you a stock move, then show you how to connect that move to other moves, and then he guides you through various approaches for twisting and turning those moves into your own.

In Fingerstyle Blues Handbook 1, David Hamburger introduced you to the world of solo instrumental blues guitar with twenty progressive lessons in the essential steady-bass style. Now, with Fingerstyle Handbook 2, Hamburger provides a step-by-step method for playing solo fingerstyle blues guitar in the equally important alternating thumb or “Travis Picking” style used by countless contemporary and classic blues guitarists.
Fingerstyle Blues Handbook 2 shows you how to achieve the finger and thumb independence to go far beyond basic “pattern picking” so that you can set up a groove and play melodies, blues licks and chord fills over an alternating thumb bass. You’ll learn how to keep your thumb going like clockwork while incorporating hammer-ons and pull-offs, ragtime-style syncopations and chord rolls into a variety of eight, twelve and sixteen bar blues in the keys of E, A, D, C, A minor and E minor. Each of the twenty lessons features a new fingerstyle blues tune that you learn and add to your repertoire.

What Exactly Is JavaScript?:

JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs on your visitor's computer and doesn't require constant downloads from your website. JavaScript is often used to create polls, validation and quizzes.

JavaScript was originally developed in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, while he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Indeed, while competing with Microsoft for user adoption of web technologies and platforms, Netscape considered their client-server offering a distributed OS with a portable version of Sun Microsystems' Java providing an environment in which applets could be run.[citation needed] Because Java was a competitor of C++ and aimed at professional programmers, Netscape also wanted a lightweight interpreted language that would complement Java by appealing to nonprofessional programmers, like Microsoft's Visual Basic.

What you will learn in this course?:

Basic fundamentals from scratch (covers everything from scratch)
JavaScript Objects
JavaScript Error Handling
validations
Debugging
Multimedia
Image map
Animation
And many more with examples replicating real time scenarios..

How To Build A True Push Button Online ATM And Run It From Anywhere In The World

Since the dawn of the Internet, savvy marketers have been pitching the elusive dream of the magical "push button" softwares…the online ATMs…

Well, unfortunately for most, you've probably been burned enough times to have figured out that those "solutions" don't exactly exist…or do they?

In my experience online, the closest thing you will ever find to a push button ATM is to build your own email list.

You've probably heard the saying before that "the money is in the list"

And that's absolutely right

But because the tools and resources and marketing platforms are constantly changing over time, many marketers wait forever before actually starting to build their email list in the first place (even though they KNOW that's the secret to all the other 6,7, and 8-figure marketers they loathe and envy)

So, in this course I'm stripping all the information overload down to just a few simple tool and principles…the ESSENTIAL lean startup tools you need to help you build a simple, scalable, and sustainable push button online empire from scratch…that you can run from ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MP4 | AVC 298kbps | English | 1728x1080 | 30fps | 3h 10mins | AAC stereo 235kbps | 772 MB
Genre: Video Training

Mark my words: Vue.js will sky-rocket in popularity in 2016. It's that good. Want to get ahead of the pack? Let me show you the building blocks of Vue.

EPISODE 1 ● RUN TIME 5:02
Hello Databinding 

Your first step is to learn the basics of reactivity in Vue. You'll learn about two-way data-binding, and why it's so great!
02
EPISODE 2 ● RUN TIME 4:20
Vue Show 

You'll often find yourself needing to toggle the display of an element, based upon some set of criteria. For example, maybe a submit button shouldn't display unless you've first typed in a message. How might we accomplish that with Vue?
03
EPISODE 3 ● RUN TIME 6:17
Event Handling 

Who about basic event handling? When a user clicks a button, or submits a form, or presses a key. How do we manage these common operations with Vue? Once again, it's a breeze!
04
EPISODE 4 ● RUN TIME 11:12
A Peek into Components 

It's a bit early in your learning, but let's take a few moments to review Vue components, using the previous example of a counter. What if you wanted multiple counters on the page, each with their own sets of data? How would we accomplish that?

View the completed example for this introductory lesson on JSBin (don't forget to press "Run With JS").
05
EPISODE 5 ● RUN TIME 6:14
Computed Properties 

What do we do, when the value of a property varies, based upon some set of criteria? Well, in these cases, you'll want to reach for computed properties.
06
EPISODE 6 ● RUN TIME 16:17
Subscription Plans Exercise 

Let's focus on a practical, real-life example, using a subscription plan page. How do we differentiate between upgrades and downgrades? How do we select active plans? How do we perform two-way binding with custom components? As always, with Vue, it's a cinch.

View the source for this lesson on JsFiddle.
07
EPISODE 7 ● RUN TIME 7:09
Rendering and Working With Lists 

Let's learn how to filter through and render lists in this lesson.
08
EPISODE 8 ● RUN TIME 5:34
Custom Components 101 

We've glazed over custom components in a previous video, but let's dig in and figure out exactly how to construct them from scratch in this episode.
09
EPISODE 9 ● RUN TIME 7:26
Vue Makes it so Easy 

In this episode, we'll further review computed properties, as we tweak the functionality our task app in a number of ways. As always, with Vue, it only takes a matter of seconds.
10
EPISODE 10 ● RUN TIME 12:27
Vue, Laravel, and AJAX

It's easy to hardcode a set of data to demonstrate some piece of Vue functionality. But, what about when it's time to actually fetch that data from your server. How do we go about that? Well, I'll show you two options.
11
EPISODE 11 ● RUN TIME 6:22
Vue Resource 

If your only need for jQuery is to perform AJAX requests, then, instead, you should use Vue's resource plugin.
12
EPISODE 12 ● RUN TIME 8:27
Component Exercise #1 

It's important to give yourself little exercises, to ensure that all of this education is embedding itself into your workflow. Let's build an alert component from scratch.
13
EPISODE 13 ● RUN TIME 11:18
Vue and Laravel Workflow

Let's begin learning what your workflow might look like, once you mix Vue with Laravel.
14
EPISODE 14 ● RUN TIME 7:26
Vue Filter Essentials 

Let's return to some Vue fundamentals. We've yet to review filters, so let's tackle that now. As you'll find, a filter is nothing more than a function that accepts a value, and transforms it in some way.
15
EPISODE 15 ● RUN TIME 8:22
Managing Custom Events 

You'll often have a need to communicate between components. Maybe a child component needs to send a message up the chain. How exactly do we handle this? Well, I'll demonstrate two options.
16
EPISODE 16 ● RUN TIME 21:29
Custom Directives and Asynchronous Forms

Often, you'll find yourself in the position of wanting a form to submit asynchronously. Or, in other words, rather than performing a full post back to the server and refreshing the page, we'd rather opt for a simple AJAX request behind the scenes. Well at this point in your learning, you already know one way to hijack a form's submission, but what if we could instead create a reusable Vue directive to simplify things? What if we could simply add v-ajax to a form tag, and have it automatically switch to using AJAX for its submission?

View the source for this lesson on GitHub.
17
EPISODE 17 ● RUN TIME 8:14
Vue Transitions and Animations 

We haven't yet reviewed Vue's transition system. As you'll find, it takes a very simple approach. Apply a custom attribute, write a bit of CSS, and you're all set to go. Or, you could take it one step further, and integrate Animate.css with Vue. I'll show you how.
18
EPISODE 18 ● RUN TIME 6:19
Managing Duplicate State

When building your apps, you may find yourself constantly passing state from component to component. Now, while we can use events for this purpose - and we've already reviewed that very process - it's possible that a better option is to instead extract the shared state into its own object. I'll show you how in this lesson.
19
EPISODE 19 ● RUN TIME 6:34
Swapping View-Specific Components

If you're not building a full SPA, it can sometimes prove difficult to determine how to organize your view-specific Vue instances. If I want one component for my home page, and another one for the posts page, how exactly do I organize and render them? I'll show you the basic workflow in this lesson, and then, in the following episode, we'll review the exact structure you might for a typical Laravel application.
20
EPISODE 20 ● RUN TIME 7:50
Workflow for Swapping Components

In the previous episode, we reviewed the basic concept of how you might create and organize view-specific components for a traditional server-side application. Now, let's see exactly what that looks like, within the context of a fresh Laravel application.

View the source code for this lesson on GitHub.
21
EPISODE 21 ● RUN TIME 13:36
Alert Component From Scratch 

In the Laravel From Scratch series, one episode covered the process of displaying flash alert messages. Let's take that basic idea, and create an Alert component with Vue from scratch.

View the source code for this lesson on GitHub.
22
EPISODE 22 ● RUN TIME 6:42
Vue Mixins 
Mixins in Vue are very much like PHP traits. Create an object, mix it into an existing Vue instance, and, badabing-badaboom, you now have new re-usable functionality. Sweet!

Learn everything you need to about Node.js.

-Understand how modules work in Node.js
-Learn asynchronous programming
-Learn Node.js paradigms

We will be covering how to use Node.js to build websites. This course will focus primarily on Express as the framework that the website will be built in. In addition to Express, we will cover using Redis and Socket.io to make more robust and dynamic sites. Many courses only focus on one of these, but this course will cover all of them.

By the end of this course the reader will be able to build applications using Express, Redis, and Socket.io. Express helps by making full featured web applications easy, if you know how. Redis opens doors by making data quick and easy to fetch. Many sites have used Redis to make difficult data problems easy. Lastly Socket.io makes two way communication between the browser and web application easy. If you have every needed to build something that was real-time than Socket.io is what you want to use.

See how you can now mix your own tracks easily with awesome results! Scottie begins by playing you the song you'll be mixing together, followed by revealing the basic steps to add clarity and punch. The drums are then gone over, and Scottie uses Neutron to bring them to life as well as tame them. Guitars, Synths and effects are then explored and Neutron is applied to make them fit and sit just right.
Scottie then uses Neutron on the vocals to make them stand out and be the focus of the track. Finally, Scottie moves to the master bus, dialing in Neutron to add the "glue" that makes the track sound finished and polished.
See the individual tutorial descriptions below for more info. If you're ready to mix your first track with Neutron, check "Mixing Pop Rock with Neutron" out and be prepared to rock your mix!

Build beautiful, modern, and modularized UIs with ReactJS.

-Create lightweight, responsive application UIs by understanding the mechanics behind ReactJS
-Create reactive dynamic UIs with a fast response time
-Customize and extent UIs efficiency by learning DOM manipulation

React is a JavaScript library that communicates changes on a User Interface to the browsers quickly, without having to re-render anything except the part of the display that needs to change. Elements of a site or application can be updated seamlessly without delay, without disrupting the rest of the display or requiring the user to refresh.

This course first covers all of the React.js basics like its API to create elements and components, the virtual DOM and the JSX syntax extension, using the state, working with browser events and components lifecycle methods. We then dive in and build an application from scratch to practically use the knowledge gained in the first part.

The application we will be building is an administration page for a list of books. You will see a list of books, then can add new books and remove books from the list. The final application will work with a server API to persist the data and it will use the Redux library to manage the data state for React.

Understand React’s new componentized development paradigm.

This course is the next step for the React full-stack web developer who wants to gain a full understanding of React development. One of the most powerful features of React is that it follows a radically different method of application development. It moves away from the traditional monolithic approach and re-orients developers to creating in a fully componentized manner. This requires a completely different way of thinking that can be unfamiliar to developers trained in the old ways.

This course will help you understand the power behind this new approach and show you how to build componentized apps and sites with reusable functionality. You will learn about the changes in ES6, and how they are important to React development, and how you can use Babel to use those features in current browsers. You will use JSX to create reusable components and learn how to pass parameters between them to create reactive sites. The course also dives into building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) using isomorphic JavaScript for a more dynamic experience.

The 4-week online course that teaches electronic music production through action and practice. Imagine this., You discover that you can make electronic music with nothing more than a pair of headphones and a laptop. You own both. You sign up for a course. You're excited. You're ready to go! After 2 hours of watching dry, uninspiring theory videos, you think to yourself., Isn't this supposed to be enjoyable? I want to MAKE something!
Unfortunately, most courses overlook a simple truth:
True learning is more about developing skills than simply gaining knowledge about things. And to develop a skill, you need to practice, and actually MAKE some stuff.
Don't get me wrong—theory is important. But it's not as important as developing actual music production skills.
Anyone can read a book and understand what goes into a great chord progression or melody, but the people who write great melodies? They've already put in hours upon hours of work. They've written hundreds if not thousands of melodies already.
EDM Foundations is the course that focuses on skill development… completing projects… practicing… and having fun.
It's an intensive, 4-week online course that teaches you the basics of music production in a practical way. You'll learn just enough to move on to the next step, so you won't get bored. By the end of it, you'll have finished 4 full songs.

Size: 3.5 GB | Genre: Music

Welcome to Picture Yourself Playing Violin! It begins at the basics with no prior musical knowledge assumed. This book/DVD package is truly intended for complete beginners—it guides you through your first steps of acquiring a violin, setting up the violin to practice, actually moving the bow and fingering hands, understanding and reading sheet music, and learning how to practice a song up to a point to where you feel comfortable performing it in front of your first audience. As part of the Picture Yourself series, this learning package provides a progression of easy-to-follow instructions with extremely helpful pictures and diagrams that demonstrate every new technique and skill you need to learn, using the same steps and methods the author uses at her music academy.

Each of the eight technique-building chapters covers a major aspect of the art of playing violin; for example, how to bow the violin with the right hand, finger the violin with the left hand, read sheet music, and how to learn and perform songs in an easy to follow step-by-step style of instruction. Each lesson builds on the last and adds a new technical aspect to your repertoire. The book also contains sheet music with supportive finger and bowing markings above each note. By the end of the book, you’ll be able to play 13 songs! To help reinforce the concepts in the book, the accompanying DVD includes over an hour of tutorials demonstrating the proper posture, bowing, and fingering techniques explained in the step-by-step teaching method in the book.

Genre: eLearning Video / Development, Programming

This course tackles the issues of designing a complex application so that it can be covered with high quality tests.
A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up. It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application.

Fitness is a journey and each of our lives are comprised of stories that chart the ups and downs of our individual quests to reach our goals.
Episode 2: Full Body Punishment | Breakdown

Set your timers to 50 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest!

1. Jump Squat + Squat Press
Start standing with feet hip width apart and a weighted bar resting at your upper shoulders. Hold onto the bar as you squat down and then jump up. Do that 5 times and then press the bar up and off of your shoulders to bring in front to rest at shoulder height. Squat down and as you stand, press the bar straight up to the ceiling – that’s 1 squat press. Do 5 more and then repeat.

2. Blast Off Push-up
Start in a down dog position and then slightly bend your knees – this will be your highest point throughout this exercise. Bend your elbows and lower your body down to the ground and then push back up to your starting position.

3. Surfer Jumps
Start standing with weights in hands and knees bent. Squat down and jump up twisting 180 degrees. Immediately squat down again and jump up to twist back to starting.

4. Mountain Climbers + Bent Over Rows
Start in plank – do 10 mountain climbers followed by hopping to your feet. Grab a weighted bar with palms facing out. Your chest should be slanted forward as you draw your elbows straight back bringing the bar into you belly button. That’s 1 bent over row – do 5 and then return to the starting position.

Burnout:

1. Ab Tucks
Start on your butt with you hands by your sides, your legs together and the sandbag on your shins. Engage your core and extend your legs straight out and then immediately draw them right back in.

2. Russian Twist
Start on your butt with the bag in your hands and legs bent hovering off the ground. Twist side to side touching the bag to the ground.

3. Jackknife
Start on your back with the bag in your hands and arms extended overhead. Engage your core and crunch your head, neck and shoulders up as you reacher arms up to center and at the same time crunching your legs up to center.

Algorithms - An Intro Course in Algorithms coded in Python

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Hatch as Expert in Algorithms through clear Python Algorithmic implementations and practical algorithm application

What do you do when you need to divide a 5 digit number by a 2 digit one? You use long division. What do you do when you make a choice about what you want to eat tonight? You make a decision based on data collected from past experiences.

In other words, you use some procedure (hint: Algorithm) upon the presented data and you get the output of a certain result. In computation, we use Algorithms all the time to solve problems. To give you a better picture of why algorithms are so important, imagine any function that you have ever written before (even the simplest ones). You send some data into it and out comes the result. The magic that occurs inside is the algorithm.

There are some basic algorithms that every computer scientist has to know if he wishes to design solutions for applications. These algorithms involve Sorting, Searching, and storing and accessing data (data structures).

This course is designed to equip you with the basic understanding of sorting, searching, and storing algorithms. I will be teaching you these algorithms through a popular programming language called Python. We will learn how the concept of the algorithm works, the analysis of it in terms of efficiency, and the application of it in terms of code.

I have learned over 10 programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++, R, Matlab, Ruby, CSS, HTML, Angular JS, Java Script. I have also had a successful freelancing career programming software and mobile applications. Since technology is changing every day, I have to learn something new every time. The best way that you can learn how to program is "to program".

My job is to make this class a great and fun learning experience so that I can help you progress through your path to learning advanced Python (whether it be just programming logic…classes….backends (boring) or doing fun stuff like Data Science). 

There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Python programming and the main goal of this course, algorithms. I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how to dominate the entrepreneurial world with the most powerful language: Python.

This course was created because there appears to be a pattern among Oracle SQL courses, regardless of the platform where they are taught: “If you are able to install it and connect to a database, you are good to go".

What's more: Experience shows that even developers who are already working with Oracle databases as part of their job, tend to not look for ways to work faster in SQL Developer, and usually only investigate features they don't currently use when it is strictly necessary for their jobs.

The goal of this course is to fill the gap most SQL courses leave about this great tool so that it can serve as a foundation if you are planning to learn Oracle SQL, and also to help you take advantage of the tool's features if you are already working with Oracle databases as part of your job.



Content and Overview:

The course includes more than 20 lectures, each one starting by showing you why you need it or how it can be helpful to you, and then proceeding to demonstrate how to enable it and/or use it.

There is usually one lecture per feature, so, if for any reason you are not interested in any of the included tips, you can simply skip it, and go directly to the one you want to learn about.

The course content will continue to be updated over time, to make sure you always know about the most important features available to you, as new versions of Oracle SQL Developer are released.

Learn these tips and apply them to your work, and you will not only be well prepared to learn SQL or work with it smartly, but will also enjoy being seen as an experienced and knowledgeable developer by your friends and peers.

Genre: eLearning Video / Yoga, Health

Live and uncut, over 25 hours of B.K.S Iyengar's latest teaching from the Yoga Journal 2005 Estes Park Conference. An essential DVD for all Iyengar students and teachers!
In September 2005, Sri B.K.S. Iyengar participated in a much-heralded intensive dedicated to his teaching, held as part of Yoga Journal’s Estes Park Conference. Along with some of Mr. Iyengar’s senior teachers, he provided those assembled with his latest teachings in asana and pranayama. He also made himself accessible to his students through a variety of talks and question and answer sessions.
The five DVD set, incorporating 25 hours of content, captures each session of this important event. It displays Mr. Iyengar’s passion, vitality, and mastery of yoga. Blending humor and wisdom, Mr. Iyengar’s presence was even more astounding given his 86 years of age. It was possibly his last visit to the United States, and one that can be thoroughly savored and continually revisited in this DVD format.

Mr. Iyengar’s teaching and presence is incorporated in every session of this DVD, including: 

-Three asana classes (580 minutes) 
-The pranayama classes (282 minutes) 
-Q&A session with Mr. Iyengar (150 minutes)
-Mr. Iyengar’s Conference Keynote (62 minutes) 
-Conversation with Mr. Iyengar (92 minutes) 
-Master classes with master teachers Manouso Manos and Patricia Walden, which include Mr. Iyengar (257 minutes) 
-Performance by The Yoga Troup (40 minutes)

Regardless of the story or experience, there's no better way to write, record, and share it than through the power of creative nonfiction.

Fortunately, Complications in watchOS development aren't as difficult as the name makes it sound.

In this course, you'll see you easy it is to work with Complications. You'll also learn how to integrate some very cool features into them to make your watchOS app even more useful to your end users. Follow along as Envato Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen builds a watchOS Complication with Time Travel, allowing your complication to display information from different dates and times.

Statistics are a core skill for many careers. Basic stats are critical for making decisions, new discoveries, investments, and even predictions. But sometimes you need to move beyond the basics. Statistics Fundamentals – Part 2 takes business users and data science mavens into practical, example-based learning of the intermediate skills associated with statistics: samples and sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Eddie Davila first provides a bridge from Part 1, reviewing introductory concepts such as data and probability, and then moves into the topics of sampling, random samples, sample sizes, sampling error and trustworthiness, the central unit theorem, t-distribution, confidence intervals (including explaining unexpected outcomes), and hypothesis testing. This course is a must for those working in data science, business, and business analytics—or anyone else who wants to go beyond means and medians and gain a deeper understanding of how statistics work in the real world.

DevOps is not a framework or a workflow. It's a culture that is overtaking the business world. DevOps ensures collaboration and communication between software engineers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). With DevOps, changes make it to production faster. Resources are easier to share. And large-scale systems are easier to manage and maintain. In this course, well-known DevOps practitioners Ernest Mueller and James Wickett provide an overview of the DevOps movement, focusing on the core value of CAMS (culture, automation, measurement, and sharing). They cover the various methodologies and tools an organization can adopt to transition into DevOps, looking at both agile and lean project management principles and how old-school principles like ITIL, ITSM, and SDLC fit within DevOps. The course concludes with a discussion of the three main tenants of DevOps—infrastructure automation, continuous delivery, and reliability engineering—as well as some additional resources and a brief look into what the future holds as organizations transition from the cloud to serverless architectures.

A Processed methodology in managing project successfully

PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method based on experience drawn from thousands of projects - and from the contributions of countless project sponsors, Project Managers, project teams, academics, trainers and consultants

PRINCE2 is a non-proprietary method and has emerged worldwide as one of the most widely accepted methods for managing projects. This is largely due to the fact that PRINCE2 is truly generic - it can be applied to any project regardless of project scale, type, organization, geography or culture.

PRINCE2 achieves this by isolating the management aspects of project work from the specialist contributions, such as design, construction etc. The specialist aspects of any type of project are easily integrated with the PRINCE2 method and, used alongside PRINCE2, provide a secure overall framework for the project work.

Because PRINCE2 is generic and based on proven principles, organizations adopting the method as a standard can substantially improve their organizational capability and maturity across multiple areas of business activity - business change, construction, IT, mergers and acquisitions, research, product development and so on.

The Step-by-Step Blueprint For How To Launch Your First Amazon Kindle Ebook Start To Finish

A few years back I noticed the rising trend and power of publishing to Amazon Kindle. Having some previous experience in online marketing I sat down on a Friday night to try and figure out Kindle Direct Publishing.

The platform was surprisingly so simple that I was able to have my first Kindle ebook published and live and under 24 hours. So, in this course I will be walking you through my exact process of what I did and how you can do the same.

This course is a basic overview and blueprint of how to take your book vision from idea to completion and publish it to the Amazon Kindle bookstore.

You will learn

- How to sign up for KDP
- How to pick a niche, topic or subject
- How and where to outsource your book if you're not a writer
- Resources for getting book covers designed
- Tools to help you format, edit and upload your book automatically
- How and where to promote your book

…and MORE!

Fifty-five million people died in the Second World War, the greatest conflict in human history.

Fifty years later, these lectures ask and answer important questions about this war:

Might Hitler have been stopped sooner?
Should Roosevelt have foreseen Pearl Harbor?
Could more lives have been saved as the Holocaust became known?
Did Truman have to use the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
Did the Allies come closer to losing World War II than we would like to think?

The origins and expansion of the war in Europe and the Pacific are examined. Military and political strategies and failures are analyzed. Social and economic effects of the war are assessed.

Build a Complete 3D Game With the Unity Game Engine 

It's never been easier to make 3D games using the Unity game engine, and in this video you'll learn how. You'll go from an empty screen to the total build-out of a space combat simulator that lets you fly through space to shoot down the asteroids that threaten your spacecraft and a vulnerable space station. As you build the game, you'll learn how to design for 3D gameplay, how to make great looking 3D objects, how to create playable controls for 3D movement, and how the various pieces of Unity fit together to form gameplay.

Designed for those with a very basic understanding of Unity software (what the Inspector is, how to move around in a scene, etc.), this course gives you the hands-on experience you need to create your own games.

- Develop your Unity skills by constructing a 3D game from concept to completion
- Gain 3D object development skills by building 3D spaceships, weapons, and asteroids
- Learn how to move objects through space, fire weapons, and create explosions
- Discover how to construct 3D scenes and write the C# scripts that control game play
- Understand the basics of 3D game design and development

Jon Manning is a co-founder of Secret Lab, where he makes games and does research. He has written about a dozen technical books for O’Reilly Media, and wrote two games for ABC Australia’s children's TV series Play School and one for Qantas Airways. He’s currently working on Button Squid, a top-down puzzler for iOS, and is fond of making cool tools for rad devs.

In-app purchasing is the leading way to make a profitable mobile app. It's a win-win for users and developers, for everything from games to productivity apps. Users get new features, and developers get an additional revenue stream. In this course, Ron Buencamino shows developers how to implement in-app purchasing of premium content, virtual goods, and subscriptions with Swift 3 and the new StoreKit framework. First, learn what you can legitimately offer for sale in the App Store. Apple's guidelines restrict the sale of certain products, including real-world goods. Next, learn how to configure new products for sale with iTunes Connect and retrieve the product information in your app. Ron then shows how to request and process payments, and deliver the user's purchases to their iOS device. Plus, learn about selling subscriptions and restoring purchased content—a smart strategy for keeping your app rating high.

Genre: eLearning | Level: Beginner | Language: English

From the report cards we get in kindergarten to our college midterms, assessments are an inescapable part of student life; however, not all learning assessments are created equal. The best ones give valuable feedback to learners and provide a solid indication to instructors about who is learning what, what's working, and what isn't. In this course, John-Paul Ballard—an instructional design expert who specializes in leveraging technology for the education market—shows you how to create such assessments. To begin, John-Paul provides you with an overview, explaining the three sides of learning assessments, referencing Bloom's taxonomy and Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation. Next, learn about the different assessment formats—for example, online exams, classroom-written exams, and observational assessments—and how to choose the best format for your assessment. He also covers how to make your assessment realistic and your test environment fair. Last, he explains how to plan and design your exam and shows you, by example, how to create a rubric.

If you’d like to create a steady stream of recurring revenue, based around what you already know, then reading this letter will become one of the best investments you can make in your business.
But First, A warning

Recurring revenue (for any business) requires a shift away from old habits. The old way of doing business means you make a sale and hope customers come back again. But chasing new sales every month and hoping customers buy again is stressful and unpredictable.

That’s why I’m thrilled you have an interest in TRIBE.

The system I provide helps you serve your audience in a way that eliminates stress. By simply repackaging what you’re already doing and delivering it through a membership site, you instantly give your business a tremendous amount of stability.

This new approach to business allows you to produce high value for your clients while creating dependable, reliable sales for your business… EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

As the former co-founder of WishList Member, the world’s most popular membership platform for WordPress (powering over 60,000+ membership sites), I literally had the opportunity to interact with tens of thousands of membership site owners.

And during that time, I saw what worked and what didn’t work when it comes to building long-lasting, highly profitable membership sites.

That’s why I was hired by some of the world’s top thought leaders to help them do the same

And, I’ve not only been teaching it, but I’ve actually been in the trenches launching and growing my own 6 and 7-figure membership sites. And through all that, here is the most important discovery I can share with you…

And through all that, here is the most important discovery I can share with you…

With the right strategy…

It’s just as easy to make a recurring sale as it is to make a one-time sale

Here’s a fact: major companies like Adobe, Microsoft, and Apple have made a conscious shift away from selling “boxed software” and instead they now sell monthly memberships or subscriptions.

Other companies like Amazon and Google do it too.

Why did they make the move to subscriptions?

Because they realized that it was just as easy to make a recurring sale as it was to sell something one time. So instead of customers buying one time, the same customer will happily spend money with you every single month as long as they continue to get value.

And in the long haul, it was a more profitable, reliable and stable business model. Now it has become the cornerstone of their business with millions of subscribers and hundreds of millions in reliable, monthly revenue.

That’s great for big companies but What about everyone else?
How do YOU guarantee sales month after month?
The answer… create a membership site for YOUR audience.

Let’s look at the facts.

Every year, there are businesses that you and I interact with every day, who are transitioning to a recurring model. In fact, take a minute right now and just think about the recurring subscriptions that you have right now in your life.

Tools you use in your business. Memberships you belong to. Services that instead of paying for one-time, you now pay for on a monthly or annual basis. Subscriptions and memberships are the new way of doing business… and it’s now BIG business.

What is in the TRIBE course?

Module #1 – Your Foundation Strategy
Tribe‘s first module will help you discover who you are going to serve, how to serve them and how to determine exactly what type of membership site to create to meet their needs.

You’ll also learn:
The four reasons someone joins any membership site
The two must have pieces of research you need to know about your market
The six membership models and how to pick the one that’s right for you
The “less stress” membership philosophy
As the name implies, this module helps you lay the foundation for a successful membership site!

Module #2 – Your Content Strategy
A membership site wouldn’t be much of a membership site without good content. In this module of Tribe, Stu will teach you:

How to create a year’s worth of content in less than a week
The two types of must have content every membership needs
The #1 reason people cancel their membership
Just those first and third bullet points are enough to make me want to buy!

Module #3 – Your Marketing Strategy
The best membership site in the world is pretty useless unless you get paying members “in the door.” That’s what this module will teach you to do, including,

Open vs. Closed marketing plans (which is better…)
7 pricing strategies
A proven 3-part launch process
How to position your membership as a “must have” resource
Evergreen campaigns
Wait list promotions
I’m sure this module will cover the tactics Stu used to 6x the size of Michael Hyatt’s membership site as well as other awesome tactics!

Module #4 – Your Retention Strategy

This is one of the BIGGEST challenges I’ve seen with membership sites…how to retain the members your marketing strategy brings in!

In this module of Tribe, Stu will teach you,

The real reasons people stay
How to increase the lifetime value of your members
The 7 actions you want every member taking to ensure their happiness
Membership guidelines and rules
How to use gamification to increase engagement
There is a TON more in this module, and it’s one that I’m particularly excited to go through!

Module #5 – Your Growth Strategy

If you’re not going forward, you’re going backward. In this module, Stu will show you how to have a plan in place to ensure that you’re moving forward and growing!

You’ll learn,

The 4 growth stages of your membership
The critical numbers you need to know to scale
How to attract highly engaged volunteers
The roles you should look to hire for — and when to hire them
This module is all about sustainability and making sure that your membership site doesn’t rule your life — after all, you’re interested in Tribe and membership sites to scale your business, not handcuff yourself to it!

Acceptance tests prove your solution actually works, and using them to implement executable specifications proves your solution does what it should do. In this course we look at capturing requirements as executable specifications and implementing them as end-to-end tests with SpecFlow.
This course uses SpecFlow to write automated acceptance tests at different levels, to prove your app meets the needs of different stakeholders. We'll build tests that flex the whole stack at the feature level, so the business users are happy they're getting what they want. And we'll use the same technologies to write technical acceptance tests that flex non-functional requirements, so the technical team is confident the solution is fit for purpose. The end result is a suite of tests that prove your app does what it needs to do, and does it well.

Streaming provides an efficient way to process data in chunks instead of loading bulk data into an application's memory space. It's almost inevitable that you will need to use streaming in your applications. However, what many developers miss is that there are different pieces to the .NET streaming architecture puzzle. This course will explain this architecture including backing store streams, decorator streams, and stream adapters.
It's almost inevitable that you will need to use streaming in your applications. Yet streaming is one of the most often misunderstood topics. This misunderstanding is the result of the fact that there are multiple elements into the streaming architecture. This course we will cover many of these important elements. We start off with the overall architecture and the common features of all stream types. Then we will move into backing store streams, as well as explaining the different types of these streams. We will then cover another type of stream called decorator streams. Following that we will learn about stream adapters as the mechanism to work with high level data representation instead of bytes. Finally, we will cover how to take advantage of asynchronous operations in .NET streaming.

Recent years have seen a massive explosion in the growth of rich client apps that talk over the web using APIs across HTTP, but unfortunately, all too often they contain serious security vulnerabilities that are actually very easy to locate. This course shows you how.
Web based APIs have grown enormously popular in recent years. This is in response to a couple of key changes in the industry: firstly, the enormous growth of mobile apps which frequently talk to back ends over the web. Secondly, the rapidly emerging 'Internet of Things' which promises to bring connectivity to common devices we use in our everyday lives. In the rush to push these products to market, developers are often taking shortcuts on security and leaving online services vulnerable to attack. The risks are not as obvious as they may be in traditional browser based web apps, but they're extremely prevalent and attackers know how to easily identify them. This course teaches you how to go on the offense and hack your own APIs before online attackers do.

Learn about acoustics and sound fields by using the concept of impedance. We will start with the fundamental concept of one-dimensional cases, understand the essentials, and also cover extended topics.
Introduction to Acoustics (Part 1):

This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights.

The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch. Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The later parts will be covered in Part 2.

This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding of sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome.

Syllabus

Week 1: Vibration & Waves

How are time and space related? What about the relation between frequency and wavelength?
Does the characteristic impedance of medium determine reflection and transmission?
Do we well see the waves of a string in terms of driving point impedance?

Week 2: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures

(1D acoustic wave equation, Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Units of Sound)

What are the relations of acoustic pressure, density, and particle velocity?
How do they make acoustic wave equation?
Is acoustic wave well analogous with one dimension string wave?


Week 3: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures

(Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Solutions of the Wave equation, Demonstration: hearing system)

What about the relation between acoustic intensity and energy?
How does human hearing system measure sound and its characteristics?
Let us experience the change of sound in level and frequency!


Week 4: Waves on a Flat Surface of Discontinuity

(Normal incidence on a Flat Surface, The Mass Law)

How mathematically express the boundary conditions at discontinuity?
How does impedance at discontinuity determine reflection and transmission?
When can we use mass law?


Week 5: Waves on a Flat Surface of Discontinuity

(Transmission Loss, Snell’s Law, Transmission and Reflection of an Infinite Plate/Finite Structure)

How different is the transmission loss of a flexible partition compared to the mass law?
Does the obliqueness of wave play a critical role to determine transmitted and reflected wave?
What are the roles of partition and fluid loading impedance to transmission loss?

Introduction to Acoustics (Part 2)

Learn about acoustics by using the concept of impedance. Following part 1, radiation, scattering, and diffraction are studied. Wave propagation in closed space is also covered. Leads to understand essentials as well to cover graduate level topics.

This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. In the previous part, the course starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibration can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. They are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide mathematically simplest but clear enough physical insights. Then the part 1 ends with explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.

Following the part 1, part 2 starts with radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space.

This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome. For the continuity of the lecture, taking part 1 of the course is recommended (but not required).

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn Arrays, Functions, Pointers and Strings through C language. Learn all the basic concepts of any language through C

The most preferred language in the computer is C and in this course, we would learn that itself. In case if you don't know what C is then let me tell you it is a computer language in which the codes of the computer are written. Through these codes, the programmer makes websites and web pages. There are various concepts that are taught in these videos so as to clear all the doubts of the students in the field of C computer language.

These videos are designed in such a way that all the concepts are explained in the easiest possible way. The various complicated concepts of C are explained in depth in these videos. The videos start from explaining the basic concepts and at last explains all the concepts with examples. The teacher of this course is highly trained by the professionals. They try their best to give sound knowledge of all the concepts evidently making it easier for the students to understand the concepts.

The concepts that are covered under these videos are such as arrays, functions, pointers and strings. These concepts are sometimes difficult to understand for the beginners. Therefore much attention is paid to these concepts so that the student is able to understand the concepts to the core. This course is not only for newbies but also for the known people of computer languages. People with basic knowledge would benefit a lot from these videos as they would be able to revise their concepts first and then learn complicated once later. The beginners would be able to learn deeply as well as thoroughly.

If you want to learn from the ground level and reach the heights then I refer these videos to you. This series would take you the level zero to the top. You would be able to make your own codes with new features. Your enhanced knowledge would help you to shine in your field. By learning from these videos you would realize that learning was never this much easy.

The requirements of this series are just a few and the benefits are many. You just need basic knowledge of C computer language. You do not need to be a know-all but if you do not have knowledge of this then it is not a problem because all the concepts are explained from the beginning itself.

Learn Business Planning & Lean Thinking to develop a Complete Business Plan

This course is about understanding business planning and writing a quality business plan . You will be provided with all the relevant templates and case studies.

You will be taught all the important concepts of business management quickly along the way so that you can walk away as a business owner after this course , ready to tackle all business challenges.

It doesn’t matter whether you want to open an ice cream stall, a small manufacturing setup or build a billion-dollar service, you need a quality business plan to understand your own idea and pitch it to different audiences.

In this course, I will empower you with the tools and skills you need to create a simple, yet extremely effective 

(a) business plan presentation and

(b) a business plan document for your new business or idea.

© At the end of the course, I will provide you with a real world business plan presentation and document for you to look and take help of. 

(d) As you might not be familiar with certain business concepts, we will also go over some of them and do some assignments along the way to help you create this document.

You will need this knowledge when you are pitching your idea to your friends, colleagues or investors. Internally, the business plan will help your critically analyze your own business situation and see whether it is worth your time and money in the long run.

This course will help you answer the most critical questions you need to answer when you want to validate your business idea. Once you take this course, you will be able to create as many business plans as you want for as many ideas you want. And don’t fool yourself into thinking that your idea is worth anything; its absolute garbage unless you make a business plan out of it and test all your assumptions.

Again, remember that ideas are useless unless you make something out of them, and writing a quality business plan is the most crucial step. 98% of Ideas never see the light of the day because the fear of failure is very high. Well if you enthusiastically take this course, you will be able to know beforehand whether your idea will work or not, and you can avoid pitfalls.

I am extremely excited to be a part of this journey and hope that you will help me help you bring out the best in you and your business idea. Let’s show the world how great your idea is.

How To Build Solar Panels
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 2 Hours | Lec: 26 | 2.37 GB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Easy, Simple, and Dirt Cheap.

In May of 2008 I bought my house. Within one month, the housing market crashed and the cost of fuel, food, and utilities skyrocketed. Think it won’t happen again?

Would an extra $50, $100, even $200 or more every month come in handy? These kinds of savings are possible in as little time as it takes to get your next utility bill. I was able to bring my utility costs down from over $500 a month to $75. Money back in my pocket. Think of the savings that can add up to over the course of one year.

Written for the home owner who is tired of paying many hundreds of dollars a month in gas, electric, and water usage costs. This course is about how you can easily and simply build solar panels dirt cheap, doing simple weekend jobs that will add up to saving big dollars. If you can use simple hand tools, you'll be able to start saving money immediately.

This course includes 19 videos, 18 downloadable audio podcasts, and a couple dozen .pdf handouts covering every aspect of building your own solar panels. It goes from explaining the fundamentals how the solar industry is tricking you into paying 1000’s of dollars more than necessary, to mounting the finished solar panels on your roof.

You'll learn…

Why build your own solar panels? (Not for the reasons you think!)
How to Get the Government to Pay For Your Energy System.
How much manufactured solar panels should cost and what you should pay for them.
How solar systems work, and how to decide if solar is right for you.
The tools and materials needed, where to buy them, and a handy shopping list.
Building a frame that will last for years.
Assembling and wiring your solar cells correctly the first time.
Installing the finished cells in the frame.
Wiring it all together, easily and completely.
Mounting the Plexiglas to the frame.
Installing the junction box.
Mounting your completed solar panel on your roof.
Did I mention the FREE bonuses?

How to get all the FREE glass needed for any solar project
How to get FREE deep cycle batteries.
How to get FREE solar panels.
If you’re considering buying solar panels, what to ask, who to look for, and how to know if you’re being ripped off.
I have written my instructions in very simple English so that anybody can do this.


Every single technique which I reveal in this course is tested, proven, and can be done easily in a weekend with basic tools. I am going to give you full step-by-step instructions and very clear diagrams and photos for you to follow. 

There are even .pdf downloads you can take into the shop with you, so that you can start building your own solar panels in just a few hours

Best of all, depending on your “recycling” abilities you could pay $100 or less per panel.

Every minute you delay is actually COSTING you money….

Get started now, for less than the cost of take-out pizza, and start saving money immediately.

in this course i'm going to be showing how to apply the cinematic effect to your photographs. The cinematic effect that we're going for is the teal-orange look, which is a typical movie effect in action movies. 

This effect gives the dark shades of your image a cool teal tone, while the light shades take a warm orange look. This makes the actor stand out since the colors are complementary and creates a "pop"when put side by side .

Lecturer: Craig R. Koester, Ph.D.

Rightly recognized as one of the world’s most important spiritual texts, the Bible has shaped thousands of years of faith, art, and human history. Yet for all its importance to believers and nonbelievers alike, we rarely engage with the Bible as a collection of unique narratives that were only later united into what we now know as the Old and New Testaments. And these different texts—historical narratives, dramatic visions, poems, songs, letters—speak to a broad range of experience, from joy and wonder to tragedy and mystery.

If you have a clever anecdote, an interesting memory, a new way to explain how something works, or an opinion on a social or political issue, then you have an essay in you. Unlike a novel, history book, or scientific publication, essays provide you with the versatility to express all the various facets that make you you. The concise and direct nature of an essay means that you may tap into your sense of wit, share your individual point of view, persuade others to your perspective, and record a part of your memories for future generations in as many distinct essay forms as you wish.

Discover the keys to unlocking your potential in essay writing with Becoming a Great Essayist. These 24 illuminating lectures explore numerous genres or types of essays, challenge you with stimulating writing prompts, and provide insights into how to get to know yourself like never before so that you may write honest, compelling, and GREAT essays. And because essays are so flexible in their style and function, the skills you build writing great essays may be applied to almost all other forms of writing.

Dr. Jennifer Cognard-Black, Professor of English at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, is your expert guide. Professor Cognard-Black—who is an award-winning author, a 2012 Fulbright Scholar, and a former student of the renowned author Jane Smiley—has an intimate, honest, and direct approach. She teaches you that the versatility and expressiveness of the essay make it an ideal medium for crafting stories and drawing perspectives out of even the most reluctant writers. As Professor Cognard-Black notes, “The essay has no fixed parameters apart from including a first-person narrator who is intent on telling the truth. An essay’s form and style is entirely dependent upon your purpose—and your audience. You get to create a new form, and adopt a new style, with each essay that you write.… Essays explore. Essays imagine. Essays digress. Their structures don’t have to have fixed rules.” The goal of a great essay is to connect a personal experience, an idea, or a memory to the world outside of yourself—and the first step is to look deep within your memories, knowledge, and opinions to find that experience. When mastered, the ability to write a great essay provides a solid foundation that allows you to move into other forms of writing with both confidence and skill.

The first step in your journey with Professor Cognard-Black is to redefine what the essay means. For many, the word “essay” brings flashbacks of the schoolroom. Whether you were the kind of student who couldn’t wait to get started or one who faced each writing assignment with a feeling of dread, this course will change how you think about and approach the essay. From the very first lecture, you’ll see how the five-paragraph essay you might remember is vastly different from the master-level essays you’ll review, analyze, and learn to create. You’ll get instrumental insight into what makes an essay great; learn how to work your own stories, perspectives, and memories into a compelling piece; and investigate what to do once you’ve crafted an essay that you want to share.

Essay Types: From Personal to Public

Since the 16th century, essays have served as a means of connection: a way to persuade others to a certain perspective, a medium to tell a story, and a written record of individual and national histories. The word “essay” comes from the French essai, meaning an attempt or a trial, which speaks to the flexibility of the form in both delivery and outcomes. The essay itself is a thought experiment which can employ a variety of lengths, styles, and genres, including political, personal, humorous, and historical approaches. Further, a well-written essay may evoke an assortment of emotions or reactions. These works, often short yet profoundly poignant, have the power to make readers laugh, cry, think, or change their opinions or actions. Even the delivery platforms are versatile—essays are published in journals and newspapers, anthologies and collections, blogs and web pages, and more.

When it comes to crafting a great piece of writing, Professor Cognard-Black begins with well-established principles derived from Aristotle, who believed that writers are most convincing when they create a strong ethos (or credibility), and then support this ethos with appeals to reason (logos) and emotion (pathos). Similar rhetorical strategies are still utilized today in creating compelling stories and arguments. Most importantly, essays use a convincing and honest first-person voice because the writer has a deep connection to the material that comes from living, witnessing, or caring profoundly about an experience. By merging what Aristotle calls the artistic proofs (the pathos of the essay, or the personal experience and thoughts, and the logos of the essay, or rationality) with the inartistic proofs (or research and data), your essay will come across as credible even to skeptical readers.

Services are a major piece of every AngularJS application and will likely make up the majority of the code you write in your own apps. Creating your own services requires understanding the different types of services and how and why to use each of them. The framework also provides lots of built-in services that can help you manage network requests, asynchronous execution, routing, and much more. Taking full advantage of that functionality requires a deep understanding of what is possible and how to use it to fit your particular situation. This course will teach you all of these things so you can build great applications with Google's popular framework.

Stay up to date with the new syntax and features of the latest version of JavaScript, ES6. You'll learn about features like rest and spread operators, the new 'symbol' type, as well as Iterators, Generators, Promises, and more.

ES6 is a major update to the JavaScript language–it now looks and feels modern, and the updated features fix many problems with the earlier JavaScript versions. If you want to keep your JavaScript developing skills up to date, this course, Rapid ES6 Training, will help you to do that. You'll cover major new features including Iterators, Generators, symbols, and a built-in Promise library. You'll also learn about arrays collections. Finally, you'll discover the new meta-programming features with the Reflect API and Proxy API. By the end of this course, you will have a foundational knowledge of one of the latest web language features, ES6, and you'll be able to use it to write your code better.

Intermediate Concepts in Fractal Geometry Programmed in Python

This is an introduction to both graphical programming in Python and fractal geometry at an intermediate level.

We learn through coding examples in which you type along with me as we go through examples of fractals created with iteration, recursion, cellular automata, and chaos.

These concepts are implemented in Python using it's built-in Tkinter and turtle graphics libraries, so no special packages have to be brought in by the user, in fact by the time we are done you could write graphical packages on your own!

By the end of these lectures you will

Have the tools to create any graphical object in Python you want
Understand and create classical fractals such as the Koch curve, Seirpinski triangle, and Dragon curve
Be able to use recursion and iteration in Python functions
Use the concept of cellular automata to animate objects in Python by playing Conway's Game of Life

End to End guide for understanding , configuring , implementing and troubleshooting Cisco Wide Area Application Services

This course is all about the Cisco WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)

The course is designed in a such a way that after taking this you will be able to understand its need in the Network , its multiple way of deployments and its architecture.

Most important thing i have taken care while designing of this course is , i have not cut short with basic technical details , which mostly been under-looked and you can still configure and implement without messing up with those information , but that is not my way of learning or teaching , you have to be good with basics of any technology .

While i was struggling with my previous organisation's WAAS deployment , i have searched a lot in internet but i wouldn't able to find a single blog or videos on this , which can explain this end to end , every time i ends up with bits and pieces of information , so this course really provide you a very systematic way of learning this technology end to end.

Today every network is running over the WAN , So you should be using or should use a WAN optimization and this course is all about that….

He begins by explaining his system of visual vocabularies, which describe how to replace the visual characteristics of a photograph with that of expressive painting, and also shares the custom brush sets and actions he uses to achieve these results in Adobe Photoshop. The course also covers working with filters, layers, effects, and more to add further detail and texture.
Topics include:

Setting up a Wacom tablet
Removing lens distortions
Correcting distracting image elements
Making shadow and highlight adjustments
Simplifying details with filters and Smart Blur
Modifying color
Cloning layers
Using a traditional paint color swatch set
Using custom actions

As this course is full of practicals so its not like i am just putting the commands and you are watching it like a movies , its an interactive course in which i have a long discussion on each and every command ,its effects , its usage and all..

Most important thing i have taken care while designing of this course is , i have not cut short with basic technical details , which mostly been under-looked and you can still configure and implement without messing up with those information , but that is not my way of learning or teaching , you have to be good with basics of any technology

My main motive behind this course is to make you capable enough so that if you go back and read all the concepts of OSPF you can easily LAB it up on your own creative typologies , you will feel its really a better approach for understating ,which at the same time prepare you for your CCIE LAB as well.

This course aims to get beyond all the hype in the big data world and focus on what really works for building robust, highly-scalable batch and real-time systems. In this course, Applying the Lambda Architecture with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra, you'll string together different technologies that fit well and have been designed by some of the companies with the most demanding data requirements (such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) to companies that are leading the way in the design of data processing frameworks, like Apache Spark, which plays an integral role throughout this course. You'll look at each individual component and work out details about their architecture that make them good fits for building a system based on the Lambda Architecture. You'll continue to build out a full application from scratch, starting with a small application that simulates the production of data in a stream, all the way to addressing global state, non-associative calculations, application upgrades and restarts, and finally presenting real-time and batch views in Cassandra. When you're finished with this course, you'll be ready to hit the ground running with these technologies to build better data systems than ever.

Actions are one of the best features in Photoshop. They make your workflow more efficient and consistent. In this course you’ll learn why their reputation for being hard to create is unwarranted by building a custom colour toning action.

The difference between a good and a great image often comes down to colour. You can start with a great subject, nail the composition and expose the image perfectly, but, if you don’t get the colours right, it will still look like a snapshot. The action you will build provides all the layers you need and a great framework for colour toning.

Learn how to use the internet, build a website and more importantly how to promote it so that it gets viewers.

If I taught you how to build a website, I wouldn't be doing you any favors. There are nearly 1 billion active websites on the internet as we speak. 

What are the chances that someone is going to visit your website? You have a better chance of winning the lottery.

If I taught you how to build a website, like everyone else does, then what could you do with it? 
Probably not as much as you had hoped because all of those other teachers out there didn't set you up for success. 
They completely leaped over the building block skills that you should have before you even start to think about a website.. 
and they stopped as soon as that website was built, leaving you with the hope that "If you build it, they will come". Then they didn't.

I've been making money online now for 7 years and I recently decided I was going to start teaching others how to do it. 
So like any venture you decide to get in to, you need to do your research and find out where you can break through. 
I was AMAZED, about how disappointed I was, with what I found. 
Most of the material on "How to Make Money Online" is so out of date it's hardly useful at all and because of that, there are many unfortunate people out there disappointed and probably blaming themselves for not being able to get to where they were built up to believe they could. 

Here's what I know, you don't want build a website. You want to build something you can be proud of, passionate about, and make money while you're doing it.
Because doing anything other than what makes you happy, isn't living, it's only surviving.

You only need three things to make that happen.

1. Know your goal.
I thought mine was playing games, that is how I started out, but as we learn, and as we grow, we change. 
We evolve into someone so much better. I am not the same person, I am so much better.
Jim Rohn is an entrepreneur and he said 
"Successful people do what unsuccessful people are not willing to do. 
Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better. 
Don't wish for less problems; wish for more skills. 
Don't wish for less challenge; wish for more wisdom."

2. Knowledge Foundation - It's the more you know. When you're informed and you have all your faculties about you, you are unstoppable.
Nearly any obstacle that stands in your way, you will find a way around it, under it, over it, and always get through it.
I have to say nearly because it's inevitable that there will be failures, some ideas just don't work out, but that doesn't have to end you.
"Success is not final; Failure in not fatal, it's the courage to continue, that counts" ~ Winston Churchill

3. Community - This isn't a one-sided conversation. When you join this course, you are joining a community of people that have the same goal. 
We all want to be better and we're going to make it happen.
"Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have." ~ Margaret Mead

You're not going to walk away from this thinking it's another broken promise.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Did you wonder how to present your surface patterns in the best possible way with cohesive look, even if you use them for wallpaper, fabric, shoes, camera, shoes or even cloths?

Was your budget too low to get really good photos that don't everybody use them? I mean did you wonder how to stand up with your design, if everybody use the same free image that you do? And even if you do want the free photo, well everybody want them…right? One big problem is how to get the same feel of the sofa bed, and kids t-shirt that when you will use them in your portfolio, that it will get a feel that all designs are from the same designer, YOU.

I mean you did want to present your design not how much did you spend for photo mock-ups right? Or even worse, to see somebody else use the same mock-up, like 10 people that you did see, and you even don't know how much are there others, who use the same mock-up over and over.

If you are wondering about the topic, I could present you my solution to it.

You wonder what is the difference?

It's huge, because for your mock-ups you will use your drawing. Yes, your, and I promise you have unique drawing style already, and even if you think you can't draw, I will show you how you could.

In this course, we will walk through the basics of Wireshark. Because Wireshark only captures what it sees on the network, we will also describe common protocols, and examine their operation using Wireshark captures.
Wireshark is an amazing utility designed to give network engineers the ability to see into network communications in real time. Since it is a community-supported application, it is free to users! In this series, we will walk through all of the basics you need to get yourself familiar with what Wireshark is doing, as well as how you can use Wireshark to examine the operation of network protocols. First, we will examine what Wireshark is doing during a packet capture, and then we will move into some of the options available to capture traffic, including capturing traffic on more than one interface, as well as using the command line interface on systems to capture traffic. Next, since Wireshark parses out the headers of each piece of data it captures, you're able to examine the header at each layer of communication. In this series, we will take a look at ARP, ICMP(used for Ping), TCP, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, and SSH.

Reading Biblical Literature: Genesis to Revelation

Rightly recognized as one of the world’s most important spiritual texts, the Bible has shaped thousands of years of faith, art, and human history. Yet for all its importance to believers and nonbelievers alike, we rarely engage with the Bible as a collection of unique narratives that were only later united into what we now know as the Old and New Testaments. And these different texts—historical narratives, dramatic visions, poems, songs, letters—speak to a broad range of experience, from joy and wonder to tragedy and mystery.

The diversity of material in biblical books like Exodus, Isaiah, Psalms, Mark, and Revelation that has prompted people throughout history (from religious scholars to celebrated artists to everyday worshippers) to ponder and debate the meaning of these classic texts. To truly understand and appreciate the Bible’s many perspectives on faith, war, suffering, love, memory, community, and other enduring themes, it is enlightening to use a literary approach to reading and thinking about these separate books.

What do you learn when you consider biblical books with a focus on their settings, narrative structures, characterizations, images, and themes?
How do various biblical books offer quite different responses to events and issues, challenging readers to think of them in bold new ways?
How does this respectful perspective help us better understand the early history of Judaism and Christianity, as well as the roots of religious belief?

Enjoy an intellectual adventure like no other in Reading Biblical Literature, which offers a comprehensive, book-by-book analysis of the Bible from the fascinating perspective of literature and narrative. Delivered by religion scholar and acclaimed professor Craig R. Koester of Luther Seminary, these 36 lectures guide you through ancient stories, empowering you to engage with the books of the Bible as richly meaningful texts. From the stories of figures like Moses and King David to the gospel accounts of Jesus and the formation of the earliest Christian communities, this course offers an unforgettably vivid sense of the Bible as a tale filled with complex characters, dramatic conflicts, universal themes, inspirational wisdom, hidden meanings, revolutionary crises, and powerful life lessons. No wonder it’s considered the greatest story ever told.

Begin “In the Beginning…”

Composed over the span of 10 centuries, the books of the Bible are today divided into those of the Old Testament (known to some as the Jewish Bible) and the New Testament (the cornerstone of the Christian faith). But there’s no need to be overwhelmed by the sheer size of the Bible. Reading Biblical Literature lets you encounter these books in a manner that’s accessible and engaging.

Professor Koester begins these lectures at the only appropriate place: with the creation of the universe as recounted in the book of Genesis. From there, you’ll plunge into Old Testament plotlines dealing with migration and exile, slavery and deliverance, anticipation and disappointment, conflict and reconciliation. It’s the story of the formation of the people of Israel, and along the way you’ll reconsider your ideas about a variety of biblical figures, moments, and ideas ranging from the familiar to the often overlooked.

One tower, many stories: At surprising moments in Genesis, God comes to regret ever creating humankind. One instance of this is the famous story of the construction of the tower of Babel. As you’ll investigate, it can be read in different ways: as a sort of folk tale, a critique of ancient society, and a commentary on humanity’s refusal to live within limits. The multiple levels of possible meaning create a more deeply significant story.
Abraham’s funny fallibility: One aspect that is often overlooked in reading Abraham’s life story is the inherent humor in it. There are certainly points where Abraham is portrayed as faithful and courageous, but he also appears as someone who can be woefully short-sighted, whose actions create as many problems as they solve. And yet this familiar trait makes the biblical patriarch all the more engaging, and all the more human.
King Saul vs. King Macbeth: The rise and fall of Israel’s first king, Saul, is a tale of ambition and arrogance similar to that of the medieval king Macbeth in Shakespeare’s eponymous play. There are machinations and prophecies of doom, political paranoia and the drive for power, and even a witch. Ultimately, in both worlds, people must deal with the consequences of their actions—and the will of God.
Words of wisdom: The Old Testament is packed with writings that form the core of the Bible’s wisdom literature, collected in Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job. The first book offers advice on how to lead a prosperous and meaningful life, the second is an unsettling and thought-provoking reflection on the emptiness of success, and the third challenges the idea that life is fair and suffering is meted out by God in proportion to wrongdoing. Each of these books, you’ll learn, is in conversation with one another on many levels.

This course provides an overview of the issue of postharvest loss of grains by exploring essential physical, technical, and social dimensions of postharvest supply chains and loss prevention methods globally.
Each year, estimates suggest that 1/3 of all food produced is lost or wasted, making postharvest loss a critical global food security and sustainability issue of today. Key knowledge areas are presented including:
-An overview of postharvest loss
-Supply chain activities such as harvesting, drying, and storage
-Economics and markets
-An introduction to the network of actors working in this field

We face the immense challenge of feeding over 9 billion people by the year 2050. To meet these demands, yields will have to more than double using the same amount of natural resources. In recent years, postharvest loss has been recognized by major institutions including the US government, the United Nations, the CGIAR Research Consortium, and several others as a significant opportunity to impact food security and improve livelihoods. Despite this increased attention, a lack of knowledge, technical capacity, and resources remain obstacles for stakeholders worldwide to act on these issues. This course will, for the first time, provide you as professionals, practitioners, and students, with a comprehensive introduction to postharvest loss processes and begin building capacity for loss prevention worldwide.

Course Orientation
In this module, you will become familiar with the course, your instructor, your classmates, and our learning environment. 

Week 1: Problem: Global Postharvest Loss
This module will provide you with an overview of the issue of postharvest loss (PHL) and how this impacts global food security and sustainability. It will also define the postharvest supply chain.

Week 2: Causes: Major Causes & Encounters for PHL
This module will introduce you to technical, social, and economic factors and situations that lead to postharvest losses. Harvesting, drying, and storage phases will be specifically covered as stages that are both vital in the grain supply chain and in which a great deal of postharvest losses are experienced.

Week 3: Solutions: A Prevention Framework for PHL
This module will introduce you to a conceptual framework for how losses can be prevented. Theories, methods, and case examples on prevention will be covered. 

Week 4: Actors: A Network of Global Stakeholders
In this module you will explore how the international community is responding to the issue of postharvest loss. The module will cover the current state of the postharvest loss prevention field, as well as provide background as to how it developed. Some key projects, initiatives, and approaches will be highlighted.

Genre: eLearning Video / Health & Society

Is humanitarianism an effective, justifiable and sustainable response to ill-health, inequality, injustice and war?
Global health is public health at the global level. It deals with the interconnections between peoples from all over the world. It is based on the idea that it is necessary to cooperate internationally to respond to diseases, disasters and conflicts which now threaten us all. Humanitarianism, in all its various forms, is one such response. In attempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted by a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality which marks the contemporary world. Public health – its capacities, delivery structures and finances – is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who live in the world’s wealthier countries. Those elsewhere have much more limited access to publicly funded or privately insured medicine. As a consequence, non-governmental humanitarian organisations now deliver a large proportion of the world’s health care.

This course introduces these issues by looking first at the vague, yet highly contested, notion a global health agenda. It then goes on to consider how and why the world’s wealthier countries have sought to develop a response to the emergencies and crises that the vulnerabilities of others have produced. Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when confronted with such suffering are especially important. Finally, the course considers whether or not humanitarian assistance can be considered a right. It looks at the emerging Responsibility to Protect agenda and the associated moral dilemmas around sovereignty, post-colonialism and duty-based ethics.

Within this context, the course explores these critical normative and logistical questions:

- Is humanitarian aid as a concept, as simple as the rich helping the poor?
- Are these interventions well-meaning and effective?
- Should governments be committing tax revenues – involuntarily given – to improve the health of others far away?
- Do those that can afford it have a responsibility to act in some way?
- What does receipt of aid mean for the recipient country, its leadership, its future, and its responsibility?
- Must people be helped only according to need, regardless of what a regime might have done?
- Must humanitarians remain neutral – silent perhaps – in the face of injustice in order to ensure access?
- Must the causes of inequality, suffering and violence be ignored in favour of access, action and outcome?

Creating websites is a craft. Like any craft, there are a variety of tools. To a new initiate, the tools in the workshop glimmer with potential. They are also overwhelming.

Should you learn Bootstrap, Dreamweaver, Edge Studio, Joomla!, or WordPress? Should you use Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, or Shopify? Should you learn Sublime, Atom, or Webstorm? Should you go into the front-end, the back-end, or both? And what about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Less, Sass, Grunt, Gulp, NPM, Node.js, Django, Python, Rails, PHP, Go, React, Angular, Web Components, Polymer, Git, GitHub, JSON, AJAX, UX, UI, AMP, PWA, performance, and jQuery? Where do they fit in?

My name is Todd McLeod and I began creating websites in 1997. I began teaching how to create websites in 2001. I am tenured college faculty in Computer Information Technology at Fresno City College. I have also served as adjunct faculty in Computer Science at California State University Fresno. My experience includes teaching individuals of all ability levels how to create websites: from people with very limited computer experience to graduate students in computer science.

By the end of this course, you will have strong skills in creating websites with HTML & CSS. As with any craft, the fundamentals are essential. If you have a strong foundation in the fundamentals, you will poised to grow and develop professionally as a craftsperson who knows their craft.

After completing this course, you will have mastered the fundamentals of creating websites: HTML & CSS. You will then be knowledgeable enough to make an informed decision about whether or not you need any of the tools mentioned above.

If you want to learn how to create websites, the first place to begin is with the fundamentals of HTML & CSS.

This course is designed in such a way which will enhance your complete understanding on EIGRP , and which will give you a Approach for your CCIE

After completing this course you will be able to understand the logic behind each and every concepts or commands.

As this course is full of practicals so its not like i am just putting the commands and you are watching it like a movies , its an interactive course in which i have a long discussion on each and every command ,its effects , its usage and all..

Most important thing i have taken care while designing of this course is , i have not cut short with basic technical details , which mostly been under-looked and you can still configure and implement without messing up with those information , but that is not my way of learning or teaching , you have to be good with basics of any technology

My main motive behind this course is to make you capable enough so that if you go back and read all the concepts of EIGRP you can easily LAB it up on your own creative typologies , you will feel its really a better approach for understating ,which at the same time prepare you for your CCIE LAB as well.

Genre: eLearning Video / Photographing, Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 is the key to what industry experts are calling the new digital workflow. Now you can learn exactly how to get started, and see how it can help you achieve the quickest, easiest workflow imaginable! Matt Kloskowski, NAPP Education and Curriculum Developer and host of the popular Lightroom Killer Tips podcast, walks you through the entire process and shows you how to get the best possible images in record time. In this course, Matt dives into the entire Develop module and how what you do here makes all the difference in the world.
You’re going to learn about all of the brand new sliders in Lightroom 4, which will, hands down without a doubt, make your photos look better than any other version of Lightroom. You’ll see which tools to use when, which ones to avoid, and how to unleash the power of Lightroom’s Adjustment Brush for selective adjustments in your workflow. You’ll see exactly what to do, and in what order, to work as efficiently as possible so editing your photos is not only fun, but fast as well.

Content:

Introduction (01:10)
Join Matt for a quick introduction to the material that will be covered in this class.

The Only Difference Between Raw and JPEG (02:48)
Find out some of the minor differences in the options available for processing raw and JPG files inside Lightroom.

The Process Version (02:54)
Learn about the role of the process version and which one you should choose for working with your photos in Lightroom 4.

The Basics - Camera Profiles (04:56)
Matt shows you why choosing the camera profile in the Camera Calibration panel can be one of the most important things to do first in your workflow (plus a cool tip on Solo Mode).

The Basics - Cropping (05:29)
Cropping can be useful for removing unwanted elements from the edges of your photo, creating a tighter composition, and changing the aspect ratio of your photo (or all of the above).

The Basics - White Balance (07:40)
Lightroom gives you multiple ways to set and adjust the white balance of your photos.

The Basics - The Tonal Adjustment Controls (06:54)
Before you start making tonal adjustments on your photos, you need to understand how each slider in the center of Basic panel affects the various tonal values in a photo.

The Basics - Shadows and Highlights (03:17)
One of the goals of the new Process Version 2012 was to give us more access to the details contained in the highlights and shadows regions of our photos. Learn how you can recover this detail with minimal impact on other tonal regions.

The Basics - Setting the White and Black Points (07:35)
The Whites and Blacks sliders provide a fine level of control over the white and black clipping points.

The Basics - Clarity (06:46)
The Clarity slider increases (or decreases) the amount of midtone contrast added to your photo. You can think of it as a bit of a detail enhancer adjustment when used in positive amounts or detail softener when used in negative amounts.

The Basics - The difference between Saturation and Vibrance (04:18)
Vibrance and Saturation are powerful color enhancing adjustments that work very differently. Understanding the key differences will help you know when to use each adjustment correctly.

Before/After: Portraits (03:52)

Making batch changes (05:29)
Lightroom can increase your efficiency when working with large (and small) batches of photos shot under the same conditions. Learn how to synchronize settings across a range of photos.

The Tone Curve (mention RGB is new) (03:53)
The Tone Curve is another way to adjust the amount of contrast in your photo, but with a very fine level of control over which tonal values are affected. Learn the differences between the Point Curve and Parametric Curve modes.

HSL - Adjusting Specific Colors (03:21)
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. Learn how to use these sliders to make large and small adjustments to specific colors in your photos.

History and Undos (03:00)
Thanks to the power of the Lightroom catalog all of the work you do in the Develop module is recorded and saved in the History panel. This gives you the ability to step back through the history of adjustments to an earlier state or even all the way back to the start.

Snapshots (02:41)
The Snapshots panel can be used to preserve particular states in the way you process a photo. This can be used to save multiple different versions of how you might process a photo, and give you a quick means to switch between those different states.

Comparing the Before and After (03:05)
Comparing the before and after versions of your photo is a powerful way to see the affects of the adjustments you are making in your workflow. Lightroom provides you with a number of different before and after views.

Creative Settings - Black and Whites (03:30)
There are a couple of ways to change your photo to black and white, but Matt shows you the best method for maximum control in the conversion process.

Creative Settings - Split Toning (03:39)
The Split Toning panel allows you to add a tint to your highlights, shadows, or both. This is most commonly used with black and white photos, but can be used with color photos too.

Creative Settings - Virtual Copies (04:49)
A virtual copy is a way to create an additional set of instructions for processing the same original photo in a different way without actually duplicating the photo on your drive.

Creative Settings - Vignettes and Grain (05:37)
The Effects panel allows you to add creative vignettes and grain in your photos as a finishing touch.

Detail Settings - Sharpening (05:31)
Capture sharpening is intended to compensate for the inherent softness in raw captures. You can get fine control over how sharpening is applied via the Detail panel.

Detail Settings - Noise Reduction (06:03)
Noise is the enemy of digital capture, and Lightroom has a great tool for reducing color and luminance noise with minimal impact on important detail.

Lens Corrections (05:48)
Profile based lens corrections appeared in Lightroom 3 and continue to evolve in Lightroom 4. Learn about the differences between the automatic and manual controls.

Calibration (03:42)
Beyond the camera profiles and process version the Camera Calibration panel contains sliders for correcting colors rendered by the camera.

Creating and Using Presets (07:10)
A preset is basically a recipe for one-click developing of your photos. Learn how to create and apply your own.

Removing Sensor Spots (05:14)
Lightroom's Spot Removal Tool is primarily intended for seamless removal of sensor spots in your photos. The tool itself is easy to use, but Matt also has some great tips for finding all the spots hiding in the sky areas of your photos.

Removing Red Eye (01:18)
The glow of red eye in your photographs is a sure sign of on-camera flash, but Lightroom makes it a snap to turn those red pupils black.

Enhancing Skies with the Graduated Filter (08:59)
The Graduated Filter Tool allows you to apply a set of adjustments to a specific area of your photo (such as a sky) with a gradual fade to blend the effect into the surrounding area.

Adjustment Brush - The Basics (08:56)
The Adjustment Brush is the best way to apply localized adjustments to just the areas of your photos you want to affect. Learn the basics of how to use one of the most powerful tools inside of Lightroom.

Adjustment Brush- Getting Creative (07:14)
Learn how to go beyond corrections with a cool creative use for the Adjustment Brush.

Adjustment Brush - Retouching Portraits (07:22)

When are we responsible for our own actions, and when are we in the grip of biological forces beyond our control? This intriguing question is the scientific province of behavioral biology, a field that explores interactions among the brain, mind, body, and environment that have a surprising influence on how we behave—from the people we fall in love with, to the intensity of our spiritual lives, to the degree of our aggressive impulses. In short, it is the study of how our brains make us the individuals that we are.

Avoid Mistakes While Buying Domain Names & Hosting Plans For First Timers

So you are a budding entrepreneur or a self-employed who wants to have your own website? 

Let this comprehensive course help you avoid all mistakes and save you hundreds of dollars and lot of headache by doing things right the first time.

You have tried to see hosting plans and are confused with so many options. You also don't understand the technical jargon and what all those features mean? You also feel its a bit trickly, how come the domain names are offered so cheap by some of the providers and are now guessing which one should you choose and why. 

Am i right?

Let me also guess, you want a quick understanding of these so that you can move on to more important stuff and get your website up and running quickly?

My name is Kamlesh Rajpal (call me Raj); a 14 years experience teacher and and i have created this course Understand Domain Names & Hosting Like A PRO specially for YOU. My students love me for the simplistic approach i use for explaining the most complicated concepts. Beginners love me because i use simple English and no technical jargon's to explain. Also my approach of subtly introducing the jargon and concepts that are absolutely essential to know, have helped many students. My methodology is that by the end of the course these should become second nature with any special effort.

Who is this course for precisely?

Understanding domain names and hosting plans and how they work can be quite a daunting task for a newbie. It can sound very technical, hence i created this course to bring a absolute beginner up to speed and running within a short span of time. If you need to deal with your website developer or hosting providers, then learning this content will put you ahead in the game, where you are in full control and you can go back to focus on the more things. 

How is it organized?

The chapters have been organised such that you can jump to the chapter that you need right away or one that interests you. Each chapter explains 1 topic and stands on its own without depending on other chapters. This ensures, those who already know certain stuff can quickly get what they need and don't need to go through the whole course.

What will be my level of understanding at the end of the course?

Go from zero to champ in this course learning everything you need to know about domain names and hosting. Learn how to choose the right domain names, avoid costly mistakes and cherry pick the right hosting plan for your business. This course saves you lot of headache and helps you choose the right domain name hosting plan with confidence without burning your pocket. 

Some advanced concepts like domain parking etc have been introduced for those who might need such services. 

What is special about this course?

Overall the course provides comprehensive coverage of topics. There is a revision pdf at the end that serves two purposes - one to quickly recap concepts and act like a cheat sheet that can be referred to while actually working.

This helps students, that they do not need to keep going back to the course, to find out things while working and can keep the saliet features and Do's and Don'ts handy and save themselves from common mistakes. 

How is it better than other courses on the same topic?

Other courses do not give you a cheat sheet for quick reference and lack the revision i have provided in.

What if you have questions? See my unique way of answering them below.

Feel free to let me know any questions you may have and i will gladly answer them, all of them. To make it easy for you, i will record videos and share them with you individually to answer your questions.

MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 21M | 308 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Whether it’s because of simple nostalgia — taking us back to a rainy Saturday morning spent with a fresh box of pencil crayons and a brand-new coloring book — or because of the claims that coloring helps to reduce stress, the adult coloring book craze shows no signs of stopping. Adult coloring books are generally printed on a higher quality of paper, with much more intricate designs than those made for children. And the price usually reflects these differences.

So wouldn’t it be nice if we could create our own?

In this class, I’m going to show you the exact process that I use to create mandala style adult coloring book pages.

In the first lesson, I’ll show you how to set up your document and create your guidelines. In lesson 2, you’ll learn how to create and place symbols so that Illustrator does all the hard work for you. In the next lesson, I’ll show you exactly

how I created my coloring page,
some tips and tricks for correcting common problems,
how to easily create some common shapes,
and how to quickly fill up your page.

Genre: eLearning Video / Science, Medicine, Biology and Genetics

A critical, unbiased introduction to using new genomic tools for diagnosing and managing disease.
Precision medicine has the potential to change fundamentally how health care is practiced, but requires a health care workforce that understands the complexities of this field. One important component of Precision Medicine is the use of an individual’s genomic information to offer targeted treatment, tailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide participants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical applications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity and utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and social issues inherent in this field.

The course is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be accessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic understanding of genetics. It is designed to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and practical information about real-world applications of genomics. The first two lessons offer a basic primer on molecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient populations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics and present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test.

In this installment of DaVinci Resolve Guru, colorist Patrick Inhofer guides you through the process of moving your timelines into DaVinci Resolve from Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, and Avid Media Composer. This process is often called "round tripping" by colorists and editors. You'll find out how to prepare timelines for export into DaVinci Resolve, and learn what features will survive import into Resolve and what features will kill the round-tripping process. You'll also explore the concept of conforming. Conforming is verifying your timeline in Resolve precisely matches the timeline exported from your non-linear editor. Plus, learn the options for sending your color corrected timeline back to your nonlinear editor for final graphics and export.

Before we begin: the practical use of the course you are going to see has been proven by thousands of people all over the world – beginners and computer geeks as well. People who make their first steps in computer / network security and professionals: network administrators, programmers, pentesters, black- and white hat hackers. Please, read carefully what we'd like to share with you.

A rootkit is a stealthy type of software, typically malicious, designed to hide the existence of certain processes or programs from normal methods of detection and enable continued privileged access to a computer. - definition by Wikipedia

You can ignore the fact that rootkits really exist,
You can pretend that goverment agencies don't use rootkits,
You can even believe that big companies don't spend huge amount of money for developing malicious software that can spy on you and your family,
You can just turn a blind eye on it and ignore these fact.

Government works best when citizens are directly engaged in policymaking and public service delivery. What conditions are necessary for inclusive and effective citizen engagement? Can it positively improve people's lives? This course provides an overview of citizen engagement, critically analyzing how it can be leveraged most effectively to achieve development results.
Recent events have shown that the relationship between government and citizens is in need of repair. In just the last few years, we have witnessed calls from all over the world, from the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to the Open Government Partnership, for governments to become more open, accountable and responsive by deepening their engagement with citizens. As a result, interest in citizen engagement programs for effective development has gained momentum. This MOOC has been developed to explore what is meant by citizen engagement and how it can be used to enhance development impact.

The 4-week course brings together a diverse range of experts to provide students with a comprehensive overview of citizen engagement. It begins by synthesizing the theories and concepts that underlie citizen engagement, and goes on to explore how citizens can be engaged in both policymaking and public service delivery. Finally, it investigates how recent innovations are shaking up the field, through detailing both successes and failures of these new approaches. Our presenters, leaders in academia, government, and civil society, provide a wide range of perspectives and real-world experience to give participants a deeper understanding of whether citizen engagement can truly enhance the process of development. Participants will also have the opportunity to collaborate with one another and design their own citizen engagement initiatives, thereby putting theories learned in the course into practice.

VMware vSphere 6.0 is the platform businesses depend on to deploy, manage and run their virtualized Windows and Linux workloads. In this course you will learn how to add vCenter management services to your stand alone ESXi environment. Once you have vCenter working, we will show you how to rapidly deploy new VMs via Templates and Clones, how to control vCenter access with Permissions, how to monitor your inventory with Alarms and how to migrate workloads into your new vSphere environment with VMware vCenter Converter.

Learn vCenter and Core vCenter Features

This course covers five major topics that all vSphere 6 vCenter administrators must know:

First, we start by learning how to install and configure vCenter including vCenter for Windows and vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA). From there, learn how to create vCenter's inventory hierarchy, how to join vCenter to an Active Directory domain, how to import an ESXi host into vCenter management, how to connect to and use Web Client. We will also learn how to access VM consoles using both the VMware Remote Console application and the Web Client Console.
vCenter enables rapid, effective VM deployment using both Templates and Clones. We will see how to perform cold/hot VM cloning to make a one-time copies of VMs. We will then see how to create Template VMs - which are used for rapid copy-and-customize VM deployments. We will look at vCenter's Guest OS Customization Wizard and use it to easily establish new Name and Network properties for our rapidly deployed VMs.
Next,we will learn how to manage access and Permissions on both standalone ESXi hosts and in vCenter managed environments.
vCenter has extensive ESXi host, Storage, VM and Cluster monitoring capabilities. We will learn how to use vCenter Alarms to identify exactly the inventory objects we wish to monitor, what conditions we need to check and what actions we want vCenter to take when exceptional circumstances are detected.
In the final chapter of this course, we will learn how to install and use VMware vCenter Converter. Converter is a workload migration and consolidation tool that lets you migrate Windows or Linux workloads from source physical or foreign virtual machines (e.g. Hyper-V or XenServer) to ESXi Virtual Machines.
The skills you will acquire in this course will help make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.

The Irish Identity: Independence, History, and Literature
36xDVDRip | MP4/AVC, ~1219 kb/s | 856x480 | Duration: 18:44:40 | English: AAC, 192 kb/s (2 ch) | + PDF Book
Size: 11.1 GB | Genre: Culture, History

1902: Yeats’s play Cathleen ni-Houlihan debuts in Dublin, spreading a mythic story that inspires Irish nationalists.

1916: A group of rebels takes over key landmarks throughout Dublin in a failed attempt to spark a revolution across the country.

1916: James Joyce publishes A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, a deeply personal reflection of his own exploration of identity, mirroring Ireland’s struggle to define its national identity.

1921: Michael Collins returns from England with a treaty by which the transition to an independent Ireland can finally begin, but back home, nationalists are extremely displeased.

These are just a few of the monumental occurrences and artistic events that rocked the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Ireland gradually shook off the shackles of British rule. Alongside a long and painful political process arose one of the greatest flourishings of literature in modern times—a spirited discourse among those who sought to shape their nation’s future, finding the significance of their bloody present intimately entwined with their legendary past. As nationalists including Charles Stewart Parnell, Patrick Pearse, and Michael Collins studied their political situation and sought a road to independence, writers such as W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, J. M. Synge, Lady Gregory, and many others took a close look at the emerging Irish identity and captured the spirit of the nation’s ongoing history in their works.

The Irish Renaissance—or Irish Revival—that occurred around the turn of the 20th century fused and elevated aesthetic and civic ambitions, fueling a cultural climate of masterful artistic creation and resolute political self-determination reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance. Delve into this remarkable period with The Irish Identity: Independence, History, and Literature. Over the course of 36 enthralling lectures, Professor Marc Conner of Washington and Lee University reveals the multifaceted story of the Irish Renaissance through an exploration of its complex history and remarkable literature.

After laying the groundwork of ancient Irish history and centuries of British rule—from the Norman invasion in the 12th century through the brutal Penal Laws and the Great Famine—Professor Conner brings you inside the Irish Revival, when a group of writers began taking a keen interest in the uniquely Irish culture, from its language to its art to its mythology. This fascination fed into the growing demand for Irish nationhood, for the arts, culture, and politics of the time are inextricable.

Uncovering Ireland’s mythic cultural history worked in tandem with promoting the power of a nationalist political movement. As a consequence of British rule, the Protestant Ascendancy had become the dominant land-owning and political class, leaving Catholics and Irish country folk to nurture their identity, history, and myths under strong—often brutal—oppression. As you’ll discover in these lectures, the formation of the Irish identity in the early 20th century was a fierce struggle—a story clearly captured in the literature of the era.

See How Art Meets Politics in the Irish Revival

The Irish Revival was a literary and cultural movement in which the Irish celebrated their history and heritage through sports, language, and literature. The movement emerged in parallel with the Home Rule efforts to free Ireland from British dominion. You’ll see how politicians such as O’Connell and Parnell pushed for reforms and championed Irish nationalism. Meanwhile, writers including Yeats and Lady Gregory were rediscovering myths and heroes such as Cuchulain and Finn MacCumhaill and bringing them to the center of national consciousness through poetry and plays. The result is some of the world’s most dazzling literature—with Irish political history never far below the surface.

Professor Conner unpacks a wealth of deep insights from this great literature:

Go inside George Bernard Shaw’s determination to dominate the London stage, and see how he used his platform to satirize British social classes.
Trace the development of W. B. Yeats, who is certainly the greatest Irish poet of the era, from his early explorations of Irish mythology to his later complex Modernism.
Find out why Lady Gregory is one of the period’s truly great masters—and consider how she reconciled her background in the Protestant Ascendancy with her love for Irish folk life.
Visit the Aran Islands with J. M. Synge and encounter the beauty and wonder of Ireland’s rural life that so captivated him—and then find out why Dublin theatergoers were not enamored of his portrayals of Irish country folk.
Survey the life and career of James Joyce, from his early mastery of the short story to his enigmatic Finnegans Wake. Discover a way into even his most complex works.
Witness the founding of the Abbey Theatre and see how a national theater empowered playwrights such as Synge, Sean O’Casey, and many others.
Meet Patrick Kavanagh, Seamus Heaney, and other post-Revival poets who understood the intricacies of Irish history but who had different views of national identity that in some cases ran completely against the project of Yeats.

Great art is historical, and while this survey of great writers goes deep into both ancient myths and the modern aesthetic, this course presents historical context you wouldn’t find in an ordinary literature class. Likewise, this literary vantage presents a unique view of history that facts and figures alone wouldn’t cover.

Not every . NET development project starts from scratch. Often you're rewriting applications to take advantage of different data sources, or to make connections to legacy data in more efficient ways. Entity Framework (EF) plays extremely well with existing databases, and it can generate some of the data-access code for you automatically. Using the practical techniques shown in this course, you will be able to use EF Core with existing relational databases, and modify the generated code as necessary. Richard Goforth shows how to connect to a database, scaffold a model from it, and begin improving on that model. He uses shadow properties, backing fields, inheritance relationships, concurrency tokens, and other techniques to best map a database to an application. No matter how untidy your tables and fields, EF will help you write clean, cross-platform code that is easy to maintain in the long run.

Make the most of your data using React.js.

-Familiarize yourself with different types of data such as XML and CSV that can be ingested by react apps
-Get empowered by visual elements such as maps, charts, and grids to make your data more impactful
-Master a variety of modern web technologies such as React, ES6, JSON, ChartJS, MongoDB, Express.js, and more


React is an incredibly popular part of modern full-stack web development, and is a keystone of fluid SPAs (single page applications). It is capable of rendering data reactively on to the web, enabling users to interact with it and see the results in real time.

Using JSON as the data format, this course will show you how to ingest your data and display it on the web using a variety of techniques, such as charts and grids. It will run through the logic process, meaning that you will be able to take these skills and apply them in your own projects. Along the way, you will also learn more about the new ES6 language and how it can benefit your React skills, and how to create React controllers.

You’ll begin by gaining an understanding of JSON and how to create JSON files, then how to load them using webpack and ES6 and integrate them into a React component. We will then examine different data types, and you’ll find out how to move data between them in order to create a reactive map. Next, we’ll use ChartJS to display data in various chart forms, and finally we’ll look at how to load data dynamically from a MongoDB database and display it in our React component.

Explore real-world web application projects with Go.

-Apply Go in the real world to create a series of high performance projects
-Deepen your understanding of the Go language with optimal programming techniques and patterns
-Start exploring Go’s rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks


This video course introduces you to a range of programming projects with the Go language, demonstrating how to put the language to use for a variety of real-world applications and services. These projects range from command-line tools to distributed messaging services, web services, and web applications with Go running on the server side.

We first discuss then model the projects based on popular usages (for example how Docker and Soundcloud use the language). The driving force here is what Go is powerful for— creating fast, real-time applications and services that leverage the use of concurrency.

We’ll demonstrate how versatile the language can be and how it can be put to use in a range of real-world programming domains, whether that’s for DevOps tools, cloud-based services, or RESTful web services. Interwoven with the projects, there are demonstrations of best practices and design patterns, and techniques you can carry over to your own projects.

The projects also demonstrate the key features of Go in action, such as concurrency, and will start to explore the rich ecosystem of open source libraries and frameworks that are being continually developed for the language.

By the end of this course, you will have everything you need to go out into the wild with Go to build projects of your own.

The system basically looks at a four square deal matrix. This looks at the four real estate investment types and what the ins and outs of each of these deals are.

By using tried and tested investment strategies looking at the four types of deals, you should be able to quickly build a very strong real estate investment portfolio.

In so doing, you will be able to have a regular form of income, as well as building up a nest egg for retirement, your children’s education or just for you to enjoy.

About Cody Sperber

cody sperberSo why should we trust the information in the package? Cody Sperber, the author, is known online as the ‘Clever Investor’.

He earned himself this name through his tremendous successes in real estate investment and through his educational programs on the subject. When he first started out, he had no money at all to his name.

However, it took him no time whatsoever to buy and sell millions of dollars’ worth of real estate, solely by using his own strategies. Sperber is a very famous marketer.

Prices and What You Get

The program itself is actually not all that new. It has an offline and online version, with the offline version currently costing $2,495. The online version is much cheaper at $995. Sometimes, however, a special offer is launched so you should be able to find it for a significantly reduced price.

The system works using just six steps, each of which is very easy to understand and perform. These are the exact steps that Sperber himself uses and that he has had unmeasurable successes with.

The course also comes with over 20 modules of video courses to teach you even more about what each step means and why it is so important. After watching the videos, you will be ready to get started and actually earn money as well.

The course has been designed to be accessible to anyone, from a beginner investor to a seasoned veteran. Beginners are given all the information they need to get started, and professional investors will learn a variety of new tools and strategies that they can use to improve their current work.

What I Liked about the Fast Track Profit System

It is filled with very easy to understand information so you won’t feel as if you need to take a course in real estate jargon before you even start.
Anyone can use it, regardless of previous experience, current bank balance and income or geographical location.
Cody Sperber is very well-known for the work that he has down and has excellent credentials.
It offers excellent value for money, particularly if you are able to find it somewhere at a discounted price, and if you buy the online version.
The system is not new and has gone through various tests since it was first launched. It has been shown to actually work, albeit with some people earning significantly more than others. However, it seems that everybody is actually able to earn money by implementing Sperber’s steps.

What I Didn’t Like about the Fast Track Profit System

In order for the system to work, you will have to make the effort and actually follow the steps that have been provided to you. This is not a get rich overnight scheme that requires no effort at all on your part.
It is not an autopilot that does all the work for you as soon as you have given it a few commands. You need to be ready to do some work.

The Final Verdict

Overall, the Fast Track Profit System really is an excellent system for those who want to earn money through real estate investments. It is a method that allows people to get into the game, even if they don’t yet have any significant capital to get started with.

As such, it is an opportunity for everybody to start earning a decent amount of money. The information is truly priceless and Cody Sperber is a very trustworthy author who clearly knows his stuff.

As the program has also been proven to work in a number of real life tests, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to secure their own financial future.

You've done everything you can to logically secure your systems, along with layering in user education and providing physical security. However, the only way to know if your defenses will hold is to test them. This course looks at one of the most important skills of any IT security professional: penetration testing. A key competency for the Certified Ethical Hacker exam, penetration testing is the process to check if a computer, system, network, or web application has any vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity expert Lisa Bock reviews the steps involved in performing a worthwhile penetration test, including auditing systems, listing and prioritizing vulnerabilities, and mapping out attack points a hacker might target. She also defines the various types of "pen" tests—such as black, grey, and white box; announced vs. unannounced; and automated vs. manual testing—and the techniques and blueprints a pen tester should use to test everything from Wi-Fi to VoIP. Finally, she discusses how to choose and work with an outsourced pen-testing organization, which can bring a valuable outsider's perspective to your IT security efforts.

Follow along with the three "In Action" chapters to learn how to create a base grade, match shots, and build cinematic looks. Plus, get a glimpse into the advanced features available only in DaVinci Resolve Studio, such as motion effects and noise reduction, to help you decide if you need to upgrade to the paid version of DaVinci Resolve. It doesn't matter what kinds of projects you shoot or edit. This training will help you develop your color correction "muscles" and deliver better results more reliably every time.

Then it analyzes experience of market reforms in China, India, other Asian countries, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America at the same period. Finally, it discusses the problems of contemporary global economy and global and regional economic governance with the special focus given to emerging-market economies and their role.
By the end of the course you will be able to analyse emerging-market economies and economies in transition, taking into account their crucial characteristics and historical experience.

Genre: Video Tutorial / Sound Processing, Music Production, Sound Engineering

Max is a powerful platform that accommodates and connects a wide variety of tools for sound, graphics, music and interactivity using a flexible patching and programming environment. Max allows most computer users to write a simple, meaningful program within a few minutes, even with limited programming knowledge. But to do something more substantial it's necessary to approach Max as an actual programming language, by taking advantage of its various mechanisms for abstracting program elements into scalable, reusable components that can be combined in increasingly powerful ways.
This class will not cover every single capability of the language, but instead will focus on key concepts and mechanisms that will allow for tremendous new freedom and possibilities in Max. The class will touch upon:

-sound and movie playback
-sound synthesis
-sound and video effects processing
-algorithmic composition
-cross-modal mappings (e.g., video affecting audio and vice versa)
-interactive control (e.g., from QWERTY keyboard, mouse, USB devices, Open Sound Control)
Max programming, like most interesting topics, has deep aspects and shallow aspects. This course will largely focus on the deep aspects: principles, concepts, techniques, and theory. If you understand these underlying aspects, your capacity to create in Max will deepen exponentially.

At the same time, this is not just a theory class. You will also create your own projects using Max. This course will teach the minimum you need to start working on assignments, but mostly I will teach you how to learn or look up the shallow knowledge on your own using Max’s built-in documentation, the Internet, and the Kadenze course forum, as well as how to program your own tests that answer specific questions or reveal potential bugs. Working in this way, you will also develop essential skills and habits that will develop confidence and self-sufficiency, and serve you in the future.

Coursera - Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante
Sapienza University of Rome with Francesco Paolo Fiore
WEBRip | English | MP4 | 960 x 540 | AVC ~137 kbps | 29.970 fps
AAC | 123 Kbps | 44.1 KHz | 2 channels | Subs: English (.srt) | 04:26:52 | 450 MB
Genre: eLearning Video / Art, Architecture, and Design

Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms looking to the antiquity in the XV century in Italy.
When Leon Battista Alberti completed his treatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and monuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of nature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty.

This attitude would condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments. In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational “system” of Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first, the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system, and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.

eLearning | Yarn, JavaScript, Package Management

There are many tools that have transformed the way we build web applications, and Node's package manager, npm, is at the top of that list. It allows us to download, install, and manage our application's dependencies by running just a few commands. But despite all of the good npm brings to the table, it isn't a perfect tool, and Yarn aims to fix some of its issues.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will introduce you to Yarn, a new package manager written by the folks at Facebook, Google, Exponent, and Tilde. You'll learn how to replace npm with Yarn in your workflow in order to take advantage of Yarn's faster performance and more consistent behavior.

There are a wide range of PHP frameworks out there, and they all claim to be special in one way or another. Phalcon is worth a closer look, though. What makes Phalcon unique and exceptional is its speed and the way it loads and runs. In fact, it is the fastest PHP framework ever built! The reason it is so fast is that it is implemented as an extension written in C language that will load into your RAM as a PHP module.
In this course, you'll learn how to get started coding with the Phalcon PHP framework. You'll get hands-on experience with most of Phalcon's core features—think of it as breaking the ice between you and Phalcon. In this course, you'll be creating a simple phonebook application.

Ce cours part de la notion classique d’ordre juridique (national ou international), en considérant que ces ordres juridiques ne constituent pas des « bulles » parfaitement indépendantes les unes des autres, mais sont souvent en interaction via une relative circulation des notions et règles juridiques. Le croisement des deux perspectives amène à mettre en valeur les continuités et discontinuités, parfois les imbrications et les oppositions entre les droits nationaux, régionaux et internationaux.
Le cours est constitué de 30 sessions d’environ 20 minutes chacune. En alternance 15 sessions sont consacrées au droit comparé et 15 sessions au droit international. Chaque semaine sont présentées trois sessions, ce qui aboutit à 10 heures de cours sur 10 semaines.

Les étudiants sont appelés à compléter leur information par la bibliographie indiquée pour pouvoir participer de manière efficace aux trois examens sous forme de questionnaire.

Launch Grid gives you a proven, step-by-step plan for launching (or re-launching) your business or brand. It takes you all the way from idea, to testing for market fit, to creating awareness, getting that first sale, and beyond! We didn’t invent the launch process, but we have perfected it. And now, we’re giving it to you…
Includes:

Module 1: Building Your Launch Grid

This is where it all begins! In this module, you’ll begin to compile all the assets you’ll need to execute your launch. You’ll identify your “Customer Avatars,” craft your “Statement of Value,” and brainstorm the “Entry-Point Offers” that will convert strangers into buyers.

Module 2: Architecting the Value Journey

There is a formula for delivering (and extracting) value from a market, and you’re about to learn it. In this module, you’ll map the 8-step “assembly line” process that will transform complete strangers, into interested prospects, into excited buyers, into raving fans and, ultimately, brand ambassadors.

Module 3: Constructing Your Predictable Selling System

Now that you have a completed “Launch Grid” and “Value Journey,” it’s time to turn this framework into fully functioning assets. In this module, you’ll build your first “Minimum Viable Offer,” and prepare to test your messaging and value proposition in the “real world.”

Module 4: The Soft Launch

Launches don’t have to be risky and expensive, and in this module we’re going to come as close as possible to “Failure-Proofing” your launch. The first step is to validate your assumptions on paper, and assuming things look good you can initiate a “Test Launch” that (with a little luck) will result in your very first sale!

Module 5: Ascension and Onboarding

Once you’ve proven that your “Awareness Campaigns” and “Predictable Selling Systems” are working as planned, the next step is to architect the post-sale process that will simultaneously decrease refunds and churn, and increase customer values and overall satisfaction. Don’t ignore this step…it’s critical!

Module 6: Getting Your First Sale…And Beyond!

At this point, all your assets are in place and your systems and assumptions are fully tested and validated. It’s launch time! In this module, you’ll set your launch date, and YOU. WILL. LAUNCH. And then…YOU. WILL SCALE. Get ready, because things are about to get very interesting (in a very good way).

Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs
24xDVDRip | M4V/AVC, ~2000 kb/s | 640x360 | Duration: 12:33:49 | English: AAC, 256 kb/s (2 ch) | + PDF Book
Size: 11.9 GB | Genre: Culture, History

Ancient Egyptian civilization is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating chapters in human history. While remnants of the culture like temples, obelisks, and sarcophagi continue to mystify us, you can unlock their true meaning if you know how to read hieroglyphs.

To the untrained eye, this ancient writing system looks like artful decoration, a random scattering of stylized ducks, suns, eyes, hands, chairs, and feathers. But to Egyptologists like Dr. Bob Brier of LIU Post—a noted public educator known as “Mr. Mummy” and a popular Great Courses professor—hieroglyphs are the gateway to understanding ancient Egypt, from its religious beliefs to its cosmological ideas to the legacies of its great pharaohs.

In short, they’re the closest we can get to truly resurrecting the lives of ancient Egyptians.

Although hieroglyphs are a dead language, there are many reasons why learning to read and write hieroglyphs can be rewarding. An understanding of hieroglyphs can take you beyond the surface-level appreciation of viewing artifacts and historic sites, bringing you closer to the real people of an ancient civilization. Plus, the transformation of spelling and grammar into a dynamic pictorial code presents a challenging intellectual puzzle for lifelong learners of all ages. In learning hieroglyphs, you will actually decipher symbols and text, which makes learning this new language enjoyable and exciting!

In Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Professor Brier offers you the key to unlocking the mysteries of this amazing ancient language. Making this seemingly complex code accessible to anyone with a willingness to learn, his 24 lectures cover the basics of reading and writing hieroglyphs, including vocabulary words, number systems, and sentence structure. They also put your newfound knowledge to work, as you translate hieroglyphs found on some of ancient Egypt’s most intriguing sites and artifacts, from the Rosetta Stone to the temples at Abu Simbel to the tomb of Tutankhamen. Professor Brier opens up startling new worlds of discovery that will bring you closer than ever to a civilization that’s captivated us for millennia—and that will continue to do so for a long time to come.

Learn How to Read and Write Hieroglyphs

When learning to read and write Egyptian hieroglyphs, where does one start? Like any language, it’s critical to begin at the most fundamental level: the alphabet.

Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs is a primer on the ins and outs of the ancient Egyptian language. By approaching the topic in a straightforward manner, you’ll be surprised at just how quickly translating these curious symbols becomes second nature.

After learning the three ways hieroglyphs were used in ancient Egypt (to represent a sound, to clarify a word’s meaning, to represent a concept all by itself), you’ll go step-by-step through the ancient Egyptian alphabet. Professor Brier teaches you not only how to draw each hieroglyph, but how to pronounce them and organize them into entire sentences.

But make no mistake: This isn’t just about writing your name in hieroglyphs. You’ll learn much more.

Build an Egyptian vocabulary. Every lecture comes with a wealth of new vocabulary words for you to pronounce, write, and use. You’ll also discover the meaning behind these hieroglyphs. For example, the hieroglyph for the season “summer” (consisting of drawings of a pool, water, and the sun) which might indicate an absence of water.
Write Egyptian sentences: Professor Brier teaches you how to organize hieroglyphs into sentences that express original thoughts. You’ll learn how to draw and arrange pronouns and possessives; how to write in the past tense; how to turn a sentence into a negative statement; how to read the names of the pharaohs; and more.
Count Egyptian numbers: Numbers were essential to ancient Egypt’s agricultural economy. As you’ll discover, different symbols were used to denote different quantities. A stroke was “1,” a hoop was “10,” a coiled rope was “100,” a lotus flower was “1,000,” and the god Heh stood for “1 million.”

Above all, Professor Brier wants to give you not just an appreciation of hieroglyphs, but a working knowledge of them. That’s where practice comes in. Each lecture in this course begins or ends with a series of short, fun translation exercises (also included in the course guidebook) to help familiarize you with the concepts you explore in that particular lesson.

Ancient Greek Phonetics
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 1 Hours | Lec: 13 | 107 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn the sound of all the letters of the ancient Greek alphabet.

In this course you will learn how to make an Ancient Greek text in the Attic dialect come alive. You probably know the various lengths of the vowels in theory for example, but how do they really differ? Maybe you also know in theory the rhythm of a poem (you can make out the prosody etc), but how do the syllables add up in practice? 

Reading it aloud and with the right sound and length of the symbols makes all the difference.

If you want to understand deeply the Ancient Greek texts, or to perform them, this is the right course for you, as it is the only available method.

I will lead you through: 

the length and the sound of the vowels
the sound of the diphthongs
the influence of the accents
the aspirate
the sound of all the consonants
There are a lot of examples and all the material is in downloadable pdf forms.

You must already be familiar with the Greek alphabet, not so much with the language though: if you don't know the words of the examples you can always find them in a dictionary. This is not a course for learning the Ancient Greek language, but only about the sound of it.

The course includes:

an introduction where you learn a few things about the history of the Attic dialect and about the sources of our information
the sound and the length of the vowels
the 3 forms of accents
the aspirate
the sound of the diphthongs
all the consonants
an epilogue

With WordPress you can create a beautiful, powerful website without writing code, and this course doesn't require any coding whatsoever. But what if you want to learn how to code? This course is still for you.

The hardest part is getting started and that's exactly what you'll learn to do in this course. You'll learn what you need to get started like registering a domain and setting up web hosting. You'll also learn why you need those things and how to get them set up.

Once you have a WordPress site up and running, it's a great way to start playing around with a real website as you learn more and more about web development. Many people start with WordPress and learn HTML, CSS, and even PHP as they tweak their WordPress site.

Learn by doing. Let's go get started.

How You Decide: The Science of Human Decision Making
24xDVDRip | MP4/AVC, ~1229 kb/s | 856x480 | Duration: 11:55:31 | English: AAC, 192 kb/s (2 ch)
Size: 7.13 GB | Genre: Sciecne

Have you ever wondered why your neighbors painted their front door lime green? Or wished you could watch TV without reaching for those snacks over and over again? Have you ever walked up and down the toy aisles to find a birthday present and left without buying anything, just to stop at the convenience store on the way home and buy the only toy on the shelf?

Those three activities—choosing a paint color, changing a habit, and purchasing a gift—might seem unrelated at first glance. But all are examples of the fascinating process of human decision making. Thousands of times each day, even tens of thousands by some estimates, we are presented with choices that require a decision. From the mundane to the life-changing, our brains are constantly working to solve these decision puzzles.

How in the world do we do it?

Over millennia, philosophers, theologians, and mathematicians have all weighed in on the topic, and in recent centuries, economists, psychologists, and sociologists have joined the investigation. People have always been fascinated by how the mind works. We also have a desire to learn from our mistakes, but in order to do so, it’s important to understand how we came to the decision that led to those mistakes.

From the Trojans’ acceptance of that big wooden horse, to the factors that help us decide whom to trust and whom to disbelieve, to the food you are likely to purchase in the market tomorrow—someone somewhere has put forth a theory to explain the decision. Some of these past theories could most politely be described as “aspirational,” describing decision making as it should be, not as it often is. Others have caught on in the minds of the general public and even been published in the popular press, only to be later disproven. But the information presented in this course is different.

In How You Decide: The Science of Human Decision Making, Professor Ryan Hamilton, Associate Professor of Marketing at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School, uses research revealed via the scientific method to understand and explain human decision making. While his easygoing manner and anecdotes about surprising and bizarre choices will keep you enthralled, Professor Hamilton also shares what decision science has revealed through empirically tested theories that make falsifiable predictions and lead to testable hypotheses.

Using the manufacturing process as a metaphor to present those truths, Professor Hamilton describes in 24 in-depth lectures:

the informational raw materials you use as inputs to the decision-making process
how your cognitive machinery prepares and assembles those raw materials into a decision
the motivational control mechanisms that govern and tweak your cognitive machinery to produce a decision.

Dr. Hamilton’s boundless sense of wonder and enthusiasm for the subject of human decision making, solid foundation in the scientific method, and pervasive sense of humor are apparent in every lecture. While most of us believe we make decisions by examining our options rationally and reaching a logical conclusion, Dr. Hamilton, a consumer psychologist, shares a much more interesting reality of fascinating experiments, often irrational choices, and sometimes counterintuitive results.

Based on the outcomes of his own published experiments and those of his colleagues, Dr. Hamilton presents information that allows you to better understand the choices you face every day, the tools you can use to make the best decisions for your personal goals, and how to most effectively influence the decisions of others. Whether your goal is to improve your personal life or to apply decision science to your business, you’ll find the up-to-date research results and practical advice you need in this course.
