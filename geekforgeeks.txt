1. K difference permutation (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-difference-permutation/)
Given two integers n and k. Consider first permutation of natural n numbers, P = “1 2 3 … n”, print a permutation “Result” such that abs(Resulti – Pi) = k where Pi denotes the position of i in permutation P. The value of Pi varies from 1 to n. If there are multiple possible results, then print the lexicographically smallest one.

Input: n = 6 k = 3
Output: 4 5 6 1 2 3
Explanation:
     P = 1 2 3 4 5 6
Result = 4 5 6 1 2 3

We can notice that the difference between
individual numbers (at same positions) of 
P and result is 3 and "4 5 6 1 2 3" is 
lexicographically smallest such permutation.
Other greater permutations could be 

Input  : n = 6 k = 2
Output : Not possible
Explanation: No permutation is possible 
with difference is k 

2. Construct an array from XOR of all elements of array except element at same index 
(http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-an-array-from-xor-of-all-elements-of-array-except-element-at-same-index/)

Given an array A[] having n positive elements. 
The task to create another array B[] such as B[i] is XOR of all elements of array A[] except A[i].

Examples:

Input : A[] = {2, 1, 5, 9}
Output : B[] = {13, 14, 10, 6}

Input : A[] = {2, 1, 3, 6}
Output : B[] = {4, 7, 5, 0}

3. Generators of finite cyclic group under addition
Given a number n, find all generators of cyclic additive group under modulo n. 
Generator of a set {0, 1, … n-1} is an element x such that x is smaller than n, 
and using x (and addition operation), we can generate all elements of the set.

Examples:

Input : 10
Output : 1 3 7 9
The set to be generated is {0, 1, .. 9}
By adding 1, single or more times, we 
can create all elements from 0 to 9.
Similarly using 3, we can generate all
elements.
30 % 10 = 0, 21 % 10 = 1, 12 % 10 = 2, ...
Same is true for 7 and 9.

Input  : 24
Output : 1 5 7 11 13 17 19 23

8. Count of strings that can be formed using a, b and c under given constraints
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-strings-can-formed-using-b-c-given-constraints/

Given a length n, 
count the number of strings of length n 
that can be made using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed.

Examples:

Input : n = 3 
Output : 19 
Below strings follow given constraints:
aaa aab aac aba abc aca acb acc baa
bac bca bcc caa cab cac cba cbc cca ccb 

Input  : n = 4
Output : 43
