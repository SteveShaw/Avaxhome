Stochastic Analysis for Finance with Simulations
Springer | Mathematics | August 14, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319255878 | 657 pages | pdf | 11.96 mb

Authors: Choe, Geon Ho
Presents the mathematical methods required for pricing financial derivatives
Encourages hands-on experience and builds intuition by explaining theoretical concepts with computer simulations
Covers mathematical prerequisites, including measure theory, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations

This book is an introduction to stochastic analysis and quantitative finance; it includes both theoretical and computational methods. Topics covered are stochastic calculus, option pricing, optimal portfolio investment, and interest rate models. Also included are simulations of stochastic phenomena, numerical solutions of the Black–Scholes–Merton equation, Monte Carlo methods, and time series. Basic measure theory is used as a tool to describe probabilistic phenomena. 
The level of familiarity with computer programming is kept to a minimum. To make the book accessible to a wider audience, some background mathematical facts are included in the first part of the book and also in the appendices. This work attempts to bridge the gap between mathematics and finance by using diagrams, graphs and simulations in addition to rigorous theoretical exposition. Simulations are not only used as the computational method in quantitative finance, but they can also facilitate an intuitive and deeper understanding of theoretical concepts. 
Stochastic Analysis for Finance with Simulations is designed for readers who want to have a deeper understanding of the delicate theory of quantitative finance by doing computer simulations in addition to theoretical study. It will particularly appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics and business, but not excluding practitioners in finance industry.

302 <--> Time Series Econometrics
http://nitroflare.com/view/5668AF6F875C47A/3319328611.pdf
https://filejoker.net/goocppqbapgy


Klaus Neusser, "Time Series Econometrics" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319328611 | 409 pages | PDF | 6 MB

This text presents modern developments in time series analysis and focuses on their application to economic problems. The book first introduces the fundamental concept of a stationary time series and the basic properties of covariance, investigating the structure and estimation of autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models and their relations to the covariance structure. The book then moves on to non-stationary time series, highlighting its consequences for modeling and forecasting and presenting standard statistical tests and regressions. Next, the text discusses volatility models and their applications in the analysis of financial market data, focusing on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models. The second part of the text devoted to multivariate processes, such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models, which have become the main tools in empirical macroeconomics. The text concludes with a discussion of co-integrated models and the Kalman Filter, which is being used with increasing frequency. Mathematically rigorous, yet application-oriented, this self-contained text will help students develop a deeper understanding of theory and better command of the models that are vital to the field. Assuming a basic knowledge of statistics and/or econometrics, this text is best suited for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

Realistic Simulation of Financial Markets: Analyzing Market Behaviors by the Third Mode of Science
Springer | Economics | August 7, 2016 | ISBN-10: 4431550569 | 197 pages | pdf | 7.42 mb

Editors: Kita, Hajime, Taniguchi, Kazuhisa, Nakajima, Yoshihiro (Eds.)
Presents the ultra-realistic artificial market simulator U-Mart that can simulate “arrowhead” in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other markets
Draws on more than 10 years of academic experiments to create a unique educational tool
Introduces a new approach for interdisciplinary research bringing together economics and engineering

This book takes up unique agent-based approaches to solving problems related to stock and their derivative markets. Toward this end, the authors have worked for more than 15 years on the development of an artificial market simulator called U-Mart for use as a research and educational tool. A noteworthy feature of the U-Mart simulator compared to other artificial market simulators is that U-Mart is an ultra-realistic artificial stock and their derivative market simulator. For example, it can simulate “arrowhead,” a next-generation trading system used in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other major markets, as it takes into consideration the institutional design of the entire market. Another interesting feature of the U-Mart simulator is that it permits both human and computer programs to participate simultaneously as traders in the artificial market. In this book, first the details of U-Mart are explained, enabling readers to install and run the simulator on their computers for research and educational purposes. The simulator thus can be used for gaming simulation of the artificial market and even for users as agents to implement their own trading strategies for agent-based simulation (ABS).The book also presents selected research cases using the U-Mart simulator. Here, topics include automated acquisition of trading strategy using artificial intelligence techniques, evaluation of a market maker system to treat thin markets such as those for small and regional businesses, systemic risk analysis of the financial market considering institutional design of the market, and analysis of how humans behave and learn in gaming simulation. New perspectives on artificial market research are provided, and the power, potential, and challenge of ABS are discussed. As explained in this important work, ABS is considered to be an effective tool as the third approach of social science, an alternative to traditional literary and mathematical approaches.

Elido Fazi - Mefistofele. Come uscire dalla crisi economica con le ricette del diavolo
Italian | UTET | 2014 | ISBN: 8851117888 | 220 pages | EPUB | 3 MB

L’Europa del futuro – un’Europa solida di fronte ai mercati finanziari, democratica, forte e solidale – non nascerà da un miracolo celeste, ma da un patto col diavolo. E che diavolo! Le ricette per uscire dalla recessione che ci attanaglia – questa la tesi del nuovo, provocatorio pamphlet dell’economista e scrittore Elido Fazi – non le custodisce infatti, e come stupirsene, un povero diavolo qualsiasi, bensì il demonio più celebre di tutta la letteratura occidentale, lo scaltro, ironico, invincibile Mefistofele, protagonista del “Faust” di Goethe. In questo capolavoro completato da Goethe negli ultimi anni di vita, citato spesso ma in realtà ben poco conosciuto (perfino dai suoi presunti lettori, come il presidente della Banca centrale tedesca Jens Weidmann, travisatore, a detta di Fazi, del suo autentico, stupefacente messaggio), è racchiusa la chiave per risolvere una volta per tutte la crisi finanziaria attuale, colpevole di un aumento della disoccupazione che sta raggiungendo livelli record, e che troppo spesso si nutre dell’ignoranza di giornalisti, politici ed economisti riguardo al vero funzionamento del sistema finanziario, all’andamento dell’economia reale e al suo rapporto con l’offerta di moneta. Come scrive Goethe a un amico, “gli scherzi molto seri” del Faust possono essere capiti probabilmente solo dai posteri.

The Gold Standard Peripheries: Monetary Policy, Adjustment and Flexibility in a Global Setting By Dr Anders Ögren, Dr Lars Fredrik Øksendal
2012 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0230343171 | PDF | 16 MB


As a world system, the gold standard knitted together minor and major countries, sophisticated and less advanced economies through their common choice of gold as monetary reference. This bookexplores the experience not of the main economic centres but of the smaller, peripheral economies of the gold standard. These peripheries differed significantly. One element, however, was common: all periphery countries were regime takers with limited influence on the regime. How did small countries adjust to an international monetary regime with seemingly little room for policy autonomy? Thisbook highlights the diversity of the gold standard experience. Each country differed reflecting different concerns, constraints and challenges. However, one common theme runs through the chapters: how central banks, representing a broad variety of peripheral experiences, were putting strong emphasis on maintaining some freedom for manoeuvre in their monetary policy. The question was how such flexibility was reached and maintained – a matterthat involved the highly relevant issues of the role of international capital markets and the management of sovereign debt by the countries involved. The book concludes with achapter on possible lessons that can be learned from the gold standard peripheries for the Euro.

The Money Trap: Escaping the Grip of Global Finance By R. Pringle
2014 | 356 Pages | ISBN: 1137366907, 0230392741 | PDF | 5 MB


Why have the efforts of governments and central banks to revive economic growth and solve the problems left by the global financial crisis met with such limited success? Why have markets been periodically paralysed by fear and uncertainty? This book argues that governments have been using the wrong policy weapons. They have relied on the traditional tools of low interest rates and monetary ease, plus tighter bank regulation and new macro-prudential toolkits. The Money Trap discusses how governments have failed to understand the roots of the rolling crisis and recession of 2007-12. It argues that these roots lie in the interaction of an elastic credit supply, dysfunctional banking systems and an unreformed international monetary system. Historically, the advanced countries enjoyed long periods of economic growth with stable money and without systemic banking crises - and minimal bank supervision. We can learn from the historical experience, and from the teaching of great economists. They point to a clear conclusion. A root-and-branch reform both of banking and of international money is required. The centrepiece of such a reform should be the re-establishment of a trusted international monetary standard. This book brings together the main strands of the current policy-oriented discussions and analyses a range of solutions, providing readers with an integrated guide and analysis to the events in the years since the start of the crisis in 2007 and their antecedents in the development of the system since the early 1970s. It draws on the author's extensive contacts and work as a leading financial commentator over the past 40 years.

Talent Management of Self-Initiated Expatriates: A Neglected Source of Global Talent By Vlad Vaiman, Arno Haslberger
2013 | 332 Pages | ISBN: 0230392792, 1349352055 | PDF | 3 MB


Qualified people are scarce in global business. Company-assigned expatriates used to provide needed talent but this is no longer enough. Self-initiated expatriates, a new and diverse breed of internationally mobile talent, are filling the gap. Talent Management of Self-initiated Expatriates is a collection of research papers which explores who these self-initiated expatriates are and what experiences they have. It answers questions such as: how or when does one become a self-initiated expatriate (SIE)? What are SIEs' motivations and characteristics? What types or sub-types of SIEs are there? What challenges are they likely to face? How do their careers and social capital develop? What is the impact of international experience on their life overall? What are the specific experiences of sub-groups such as academics or female SIEs? As traditional talent management can no longer fulfil the needs of globally operating organisations, self-initiated expatriates have become an ever more important, albeit neglected, source of the global talent flow.

Marketing to the Ageing Consumer: The Secrets to Building an Age-Friendly Business By D. Stroud, K. Walker
2013 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 0230378196 , 1349350958 | PDF | 1 MB


Unlock customer value by making your business age-friendly. The world's population is ageing at a rate never before seen in history. Marketing to the Ageing Consumer is the executives' guide to understanding and benefitting from this phenomenon. Fact: During the next two decades, older consumers will be the primary drivers of consumer expenditure in Europe and the US. Fact: Asia Pacific has the oldest and fastest growing population of older people. Fact: Older people have one thing in common – they are all experiencing physical ageing that determines what and how they purchase. Fact: Ageing physiology will demand changes across the spectrum of customer touchpoints for products and services of almost every marketing company. Age-marketing experts, Dick Stroud and Kim Walker, present the first and most comprehensive account of how the ageing of the consumers' minds, bodies and senses determine the products they purchase. The authors explain how ageing affects all parts of the customer experience. Their findings represent a fundamental – and surprising – shift in many paradigms of modern marketing. Full of illuminating case studies and practical tips, Marketing to the Ageing Consumer provides companies with the tools and knowledge to perform their own audit of 'age-friendliness' enabling them to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of their customers.

Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus By Jeffrey M. Perloff
2007 | 800 Pages | ISBN: 0321468589 | scanned PDF | 51 MB


Professors teaching this course have two concurrent goals: to teach the microeconomic tools students need for future coursework and careers, and to encourage students to work problems. In Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus, Perloff brings his hallmark pedagogy to the calculus-based course by integrating Solved Problems and real, data-driven applications in every chapter. This new text offers a serious presentation of calculus-based microeconomic theory and offers a suite of carefully crafted, calculus-based problem sets at the end of each chapter. Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus covers basic and modern theories first, and then offers advanced theory chapters at the end. By providing graphical representation and real-world applications to illustrate the theory, Perloff demonstrates how individuals, policy makers, and firms use microeconomic tools to analyze and resolve problems. Perloff’s algebra-based Microeconomics, now in its Fourth Edition, has become a market leader because it clearly introduces theory and helps students develop problem-solving skills through its Solved Problem feature.

Peter Wick and Volker Rabens, "Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange Between East and West" 
English | ISBN: 9004255281 | 2014 | 396 pages | PDF | 5 MB

In Religions and Trade a number of international scholars investigate the ways in which eastern and western religions were formed and transformed from the perspective of “trade.” Trade changes religions. Religions expand through the help of trade infrastructures, and religions extend and enrich the trade relations with cultural and religious “commodities” which they contribute to the “market place” of human culture and religion. This leads to the inclusion, demarcation and densification as well as the amalgamation of religious traditions.

In an attempt to find new pathways into the world of religious dynamics, this collection of essays focuses on four elements or “commodities” of religious interchange: topologies of religious space, religious symbol systems, religious knowledge, and religious-ethical ways of life.

2010 | ISBN-10: 3642055710, 3540003665 | 448 pages | PDF | 56 MB

European Regional Growth is the result of three major influences. First, the ongoing integration of the European regional economies and the need to understand what this means for European economic and social cohesion. Second, the development of geo-economic theories. Third, the development of techniques of spatial data analysis, simulation, data visualization and spatial econometrics. The outcome is a collection of chapters that apply these methods, motivated by a variety of theoretical positions. The book provides powerful and detailed analyses of the causes of income, productivity and employment variations across Europe's regions, and insights into their future prospects.

The New Frontier Investors: How Pension Funds, Sovereign Funds, and Endowments are Changing the Business of Investment Management and Long-Term Investing
Palgrave Macmillan | Finance & Banking | July 30, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137508566 | 152 pages | pdf | 3.97 mb

Authors: Singh Bachher, Jagdeep, Dixon, Adam D., Monk, Ashby H. B.

Who holds the power in financial markets? For many, the answer would probably be the large investment banks, big asset managers, and hedge funds. These are the organizations that are in the media's spotlight and whose leaders and employees command outsized salaries and bonuses. They are the supposed leading edge of global finance and their power seems almost absolute, even as questions abound about their social and economic utility. But more and more asset owners are confronting the status quo, the power to exact high fees and the focus on the short term. The New Frontier Investors chronicles the rise of this new group of long horizon asset owners that includes some of the world's largest pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments. These asset owners are driving the business of asset management to a new frontier by retaking responsibility of the end-to-end management of their investment portfolios and by re-conceptualizing investment decision-making.
The lessons illustrated in The New Frontier Investors fly in the face of conventional wisdom, which has it that these asset owners are at a disadvantage to the private sector fund managers and other service providers. These asset owners are supposedly not able to attract talent nor do they have the organizational capabilities to compete. That many are located far from the markets in which they invest only exacerbates the problem. But this is incorrect. This expanding group of asset owners is learning how to make the most of their scale and long time horizons, finding new ways to attract talent, to collaborate, and to build greater alignment with the users of capital. They are not at a disadvantage. They are at an advantage.
The New Frontier Investors is essential reading for anyone wanting to see a change in global financial markets and the professionalization of asset owners worldwide, from public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to foundations and endowments. It is thus required reading for the senior executives and employees working in the field of beneficiary institutional investment, as well as government officials and others that have a stake in the design and governance of beneficiary financial institutions and long-term capital.

Case Studies in Finance: Managing for Corporate Value Creation (7th edition) By Robert F. Bruner
2013 | 816 Pages | ISBN: 007786171X | PDF | 12 MB


Case Studies in Finance links managerial decisions to capital markets and the expectations of investors. At the core of almost all of the cases is a valuation task that requires students to look to financial markets for guidance in resolving the case problem. The focus on value helps managers understand the impact of the firm on the world around it. These cases also invite students to apply modern information technology to the analysis of managerial decisions. The cases may be taught in many different combinations. The eight-part sequence indicated by the table of contents relates to course designs used at the authors' schools. Each part of the casebook suggests a concept module, with a particular orientation.

Wellth: How I Learned to Build a Life, Not a Resume By Jason Wachob
2016 | 256 Pages | ISBN: 1101904488 | EPUB + MOBI | 2 MB


In his first book, mindbodygreen founder Jason Wachob, redefines successful living and offers readers a new life currency to build on, one that is steeped in wellbeing...Wellth. Many of us aren t satisfied with just trying to accumulate the most money and toys. The good life is no longer just about the material instead, it can be found in a lifestyle that is devoted to mental, physical, and emotional health. A wellthy existence is one in which happiness is attainable, health is paramount, and daily living is about abundance. It s a life in which work is purposeful; friendships are deep and plentiful; and there s a daily sense of richness or overflowing joy. But since there s no one-size-fits all definition for a wellthy existence, I hope this book will serve as a guide to help you embark on your own personal journey that is both unique and meaningful. Eat. Move. Work. Believe. Explore. Breathe. Connect. Love. Heal. Thank. Ground. Live. Laugh. These are the building blocks of Wellth...and in this blend of memoir and prescriptive advice Jason Wachob shows us all how to enjoy truly wellthy lives lives that are deeply rich in every conceivable way. Through his experience and personal story, as well as in exclusive material from popular expert contributors (including Dr. Frank Lipman, Dr. Lissa Rankin, Joe Cross, Charlie Knoles, Kathryn Budig, Dr. Aviva Romm, and Dr. Sue Johnson), we learn how we too can embrace this new movement and develop richer, fuller, happier, healthier, and more meaningful lives. What will make your life more wellthy? Come and explore it.

German | 2 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658124644 | 92 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.64 MB

Das Lehrbuch führt in die Module Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung ein und beleuchtet die sich hier ergebenden Möglichkeiten von Serviceorientierung und Qualitätsmanagement. Bestehende Entwicklungen werden analysiert und im theoretischen und historischen Gesamtkontext erörtert. Weiterhin wird den interkommunalen Kooperationen auf den Gebieten Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung breiter Raum geschenkt.

Auf dem langen Weg hin zu einer Serviceorientierung von Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung haben einige bundesdeutsche Kommunen bereits eine beachtliche Strecke zurückgelegt. Attraktivität und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit dieser Kommunen konnte mittels der bislang umgesetzten Maßnahmen erheblich gesteigert werden.Die erfolgreiche Implementierung serviceorientierter Denk- und Verhaltensweisen setzt eine intensive Beschäftigung mit dieser Thematik voraus, idealerweise in Form einer institutionalisierten Aus- und Weiterbildung. Auch hierbei liefern die Autoren wertvolle Unterstützung und praxiserprobte Hilfe.

English | 19 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 3319309986 | 66 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

This book studies the transformation of modern maritimity practices in coastal areas (such as swimming, navigation and tourism) and their implications to the development of Brazilian coastal cities, with an emphasis on the Northeast part of the country. It is a reflection on coastal geography in the tropics and the contemporary valorization of coastal cities from a socioeconomic, technological and symbolical point of view. The book highlights local fluxes on a regional and local scale, showing the incorporation of beach zones to spaces which were previously associated with so called traditional coastal practices (fishing activities and as harboring points). This book is dedicated to geography researchers and students.

Not Buying It: Stop Overspending and Start Raising Happier, Healthier, More Successful Kids by Brett Graff
2016 | ISBN: 1580055915 | English | 256 pages | EPUB | 2.3 MB

Most parents will do just about anything to secure happy lives and bright futures for their kids. Add in competition with other parents and near-constant pressure, their drive to give their kids the best of everything can backfire, setting back the child and the household finances. 

Brett Graff, "The Home Economist," exposes how overspending can harm children by setting back intellect and encouraging narcissism, depression and unhealthy or unsafe habits. By unearthing research on pricey baby gear, oversized houses, so-called "educational" toys and after-school lessons, expensive sports equipment and private coaching, even certain organic products and unregulated "natural" medicines - she even has eye-opening findings on private schools versus public schools - Graff proves that we can spend too much getting our kids ahead and wind up instead setting them back. 
Not Buying It proves that sound, rational decision-making about spending is far more beneficial for our kids than purchases made out of fear, pressure and confusion. With Graff's guidance, you'll confidently create the financial strategy that's best for your family, not the one pushed by marketers or practiced by your neighbors. Not Buying It is your blueprint for emotional and financial freedom, and the stability your children deserve.

Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism by Christine Desan
English | 2015 | ISBN: 0198709579, 0198709587 | 496 pages | EPUB | 2,7 MB

Money travels the modern world in disguise. It looks like a convention of human exchange - a commodity like gold or a medium like language. But its history reveals that money is a very different matter. It is an institution engineered by political communities to mark and mobilize resources. As societies change the way they create money, they change the market itself - along with the rules that structure it, the politics and ideas that shape it, and the benefits that flow from it.

One particularly dramatic transformation in money's design brought capitalism to England. For centuries, the English government monopolized money's creation. The Crown sold people coin for a fee in exchange for silver and gold. 'Commodity money' was a fragile and difficult medium; the first half of the book considers the kinds of exchange and credit it invited, as well as the politics it engendered. Capitalism arrived when the English reinvented money at the end of the 17th century. When it established the Bank of England, the government shared its monopoly over money creation for the first time with private investors, institutionalizing their self-interest as the pump that would produce the money supply. The second half of the book considers the monetary revolution that brought unprecedented possibilities and problems. The invention of circulating public debt, the breakdown of commodity money, the rise of commercial bank currency, and the coalescence of ideological commitments that came to be identified with the Gold Standard - all contributed to the abundant and unstable medium that is modern money. All flowed as well from a collision between the individual incentives and public claims at the heart of the system. The drama had constitutional dimension: money, as its history reveals, is a mode of governance in a material world. That character undermines claims in economics about money's neutrality. The monetary design innovated in England would later spread, producing the global architecture of modern money.

Compliance officers perform a vital, yet unpopular role in the business world as they advise on complying with myriad rules and regulations. What is good for compliance is sometimes seen as being bad for business, making a compliance officer's role a difficult tone. Essential Strategies for Financial Services Compliance offers practical guidance on how to apply a regulatory requirement to day to day situations. It also shows how to communicate the compliance department?s activities to the rest of the firm, how the role fits within the organization as a whole, what the scope and limitation of their responsibilities are, what to do when things go wrong, and how to deal with unusual problems.

Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World’s Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again by Peter J. Wallison
English | 2015 | ISBN: 1594037701 | 368 pages | PDF | 2 MB

The 2008 financial crisis—like the Great Depression—was a world-historical event. What caused it will be debated for years, if not generations. The conventional narrative is that the financial crisis was caused by Wall Street greed and insufficient regulation of the financial system. That narrative produced the Dodd-Frank Act, the most comprehensive financial-system regulation since the New Deal. There is evidence, however, that the Dodd-Frank Act has slowed the recovery from the recession. If insufficient regulation caused the financial crisis, then the Dodd-Frank Act will never be modified or repealed; proponents will argue that doing so will cause another crisis.

A competing narrative about what caused the financial crisis has received little attention. This view, which is accepted by almost all Republicans in Congress and most conservatives, contends that the crisis was caused by government housing policies. This book extensively documents this view. For example, it shows that in June 2008, before the crisis, 56 percent of all US mortgages were subprime or otherwise low-quality. Of these, 76 percent were on the books of government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these mortgages defaulted in 2007 and 2008, they drove down housing prices and weakened banks and other mortgage holders, causing the crisis.

After this book is published, no one will be able to claim that the financial crisis was caused by insufficient regulation, or defend Dodd-Frank, without coming to terms with the data this book contains.

The Politics of International Political Economy by Vassilis K. Fouskas
English | 2014 | ISBN: 1857436385 | 338 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This timely book will explain, via a number of thematic and case studies, that international economics is not an independent terrain of economic activity reproducing itself throughout history, but a complex articulation of social, political and culturally determined actions that are inextricably linked. Chapters will address the role of dominant global powers in the making of global industrial and monetary relations, and, in particular, ways in which, and the degrees to which dominant economic and military powers, such as the USA, tend to shape the domestic economic environments of lesser powers after their own image.

Supplementing the chapters will be a comprehensive A - Z glossary section, which will include key International Political Economy terms, e.g. international debt, European free trade area, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IMF, GATT-WTO, Foreign exchange, fixed exchange rates, floating exchange rates, reserve currency, gold-dollar parity, multinational corporation, preferential trade agreement, hedge funds, etc. Entries will be cross-referenced for ease of use.

This book will be ideal for researchers and students in the areas of politics, international relations and international economics, as well as for academics, economists, business people, and those with an interest in the workings of international political economy.

Public Economics in an Age of Austerity (The Graz Schumpeter Lectures) By Tony Atkinson
2014 | 112 Pages | ISBN: 1138018155 | PDF | 2 MB


Governments all round the world are facing problems with their public finances. At a time of austerity, how much should spending be cut and how much should taxes be raised? Does the national debt represent a burden for future generations? Should taxes on the rich be raised? This book examines how the tools of public economics can be applied to answer such key questions and to suggest alternatives to the austerity policies currently being pursued. The fiscal problems faced are not simply the result of the post-2008 economic crisis but reflect a deep-seated fault line in modern economies. There has to be fiscal consolidation to provide for an ageing population, increased investment in education, and climate change. The book describes how public economics can help us think about alternative ways of meeting this challenge. It casts doubt on conventionally held views, such as those concerned with top tax rates, the undesirability of taxing capital income, the targeting of child benefits, and the merging of income tax and social security contributions. The final part goes beyond national boundaries and considers global public economics, focusing on the pressing problem of financing development. The conclusion of the book is that there are significant choices to be made. Not all austerity packages are the same: there are alternatives. It would be possible to raise taxes more and to cut spending less. It is important to consider the full range of possible policies. In considering these alternatives, modern public economics provides a useful framework, but it has major limitations. Economists are too often prisoners within the theoretical walls they have erected and fail to see that important considerations are missing. Economists have paid too little attention to the ethical basis underlying their policy recommendations.

Authors: Peters, Linda
Discusses well-known Real Options Approaches and its applications step-by-step without the use of complex mathematics
Enables readers to reproduce these models and apply it to their own field
Contributes to one of the key challenges of Real Options, which is to reduce the gap between theory and practice

This book explains the standard Real Options Analysis (ROA) literature in a straightforward, step by step manner without the use of complex mathematics. A lot of ROA literature is described through partial differential equations, probability density functions and simulation techniques, all of which may be unconvincing in the applicable qualities ROA possesses. Using this book, the reader will have a better grasp about how ROA works and will be able to provide his or her judgment about ROA, since all the basics, as well as its positive and negative qualities, are discussed.
Real Options Illustrated provides practitioners with a real options framework and encourages readers to study the methodology using the in-depth explanations. This introduction to ROA is sufficient to equip readers with ROA basics, enabling them to perform future independent research. From this book, readers can judge whether ROA is of any value to their field.

The Handbook of Post Crisis Financial Modelling
Palgrave Macmillan UK | Finance & Banking | 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137494484 | 316 pages | pdf | 2.29 mb

Editors: Haven, E., Molyneux, P., Wilson, J., Fedotov, S., Duygun, M. (Eds.)

Following the 2008 financial crisis many questioned the academic community’s role in predicting the events that had unfolded, impacting heavily on the public's perception of the role of finance in society. Prior to the crisis, very little research existed to model events as extreme as those which occurred during the crisis. There is now greater interest in extreme event modeling than at any other time in history and, in addition, many facets of mainstream finance have evolved since the crisis.
This unique handbook brings together original research from leading practitioners and academics in the fields of banking, finance and financial history to explore key issues affecting financial modeling since the 2008 financial crisis. It offers theoretical, empirical, policy and practical insights into many of the key themes involved in the calibration of essential economic and financial variables that are used to model crises. The book begins by offering a historical context to the events, before moving on to discuss the role of central banks, governments, policy-making, the costs of bail-outs and the ‘too-big-to-fail’ controversy. The authors offer an analysis on the link between efficiency and bank safety, the role of ‘minimal assumptions’ in modeling and the private information price of risk (PIPR). They conclude by addressing the use of specific models and possible approaches to macroeconomic modeling for the future.

OECD, "How's Life 2015: Measuring Well-Being" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 9264211012 | 200 pages | PDF | 8 MB

Every person aspires to a good life. But what does “a good or a better life” mean? The third edition of How’s Life? provides an update on the most important aspects that shape people’s lives and well-being: income, jobs, housing, health, work-life balance, education, social connections, civic engagement and governance, environment, personal security, and subjective well-being. It paints a comprehensive picture of well-being in OECD countries and other major economies by looking at people’s material living conditions and quality of life across the population. Through a wide range of comparable well-being indicators, the report shows that countries perform differently in the various dimensions of well-being. For instance, low-income countries in the OECD area tend to do very well in subjective well-being and work-life balance, while their level of material well-being is much lower than that of other OECD countries. The report responds to the needs of citizens for better information on well-being and the needs of policymakers to give a more accurate picture of societal progress.

http://nitroflare.com/view/B505D70FC897D6E/0262034379.pdf
https://filejoker.net/jpj4zoe372a2


Hal S. Scott, "Connectedness and Contagion: Protecting the Financial System from Panics" 
English | ISBN: 0262034379 | 2016 | 439 pages | PDF | 3 MB

The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 was intended to reform financial policies in order to prevent another massive crisis such as the financial meltdown of 2008. Dodd–Frank is largely premised on the diagnosis that connectedness was the major problem in that crisis—that is, that financial institutions were overexposed to one another, resulting in a possible chain reaction of failures. In this book, Hal Scott argues that it is not connectedness but contagion that is the most significant element of systemic risk facing the financial system. Contagion is an indiscriminate run by short-term creditors of financial institutions that can render otherwise solvent institutions insolvent. It poses a serious risk because, as Scott explains, our financial system still depends on approximately $7.4 to $8.2 trillion of runnable and uninsured short-term liabilities, 60 percent of which are held by nonbanks. 

Scott argues that efforts by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Treasury to stop the contagion that exploded after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers lessened the economic damage. And yet Congress, spurred by the public's aversion to bailouts, has dramatically weakened the power of the government to respond to contagion, including limitations on the Fed's powers as a lender of last resort. Offering uniquely detailed forensic analyses of the Lehman Brothers and AIG failures, and suggesting alternative regulatory approaches, Scott makes the case that we need to restore and strengthen our weapons for fighting contagion.

Morgan Ricks, "The Money Problem: Rethinking Financial Regulation" 
English | ISBN: 022633032X | 2016 | 360 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Years have passed since the world experienced one of the worst financial crises in history, and while countless experts have analyzed it, many central questions remain unanswered. Should money creation be considered a ‘public’ or ‘private’ activity—or both? What do we mean by, and want from, financial stability? What role should regulation play? How would we design our monetary institutions if we could start from scratch?

In The Money Problem, Morgan Ricks addresses all of these questions and more, offering a practical yet elegant blueprint for a modernized system of money and banking—one that, crucially, can be accomplished through incremental changes to the United States’ current system. He brings a critical, missing dimension to the ongoing debates over financial stability policy, arguing that the issue is primarily one of monetary system design. The Money Problem offers a way to mitigate the risk of catastrophic panic in the future, and it will expand the financial reform conversation in the United States and abroad.

Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground By Susan M. Opp
2013 | 346 Pages | ISBN: 1439880085 | PDF | 7 MB


A clear and practical examination of complex issues, Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground provides a broad, academic look at the intersection of two important areas for local administrators. In addition to managing development in a strained economic climate, most administrators are also expected to be stewards of the environment. However, economic conditions often leave them with limited options for pursuing economic development and, at the same time, being environmentally mindful. Many find themselves without a clear understanding of the concepts, tools, and best practices available to accomplish this herculean task. Translating complex environmental and economic concepts into easily applicable practices, the book: Gives practitioners the information they need to communicate with consultants, constituents, and officials, and to avoid ideological obstacles Compares regulatory differences between states and other geographical differences Includes examples from across the country to highlight variations in environmental regulations and laws Provides technical, legal, and political insights into the process of pursuing local economic development projects that incorporate protection and awareness Contains case studies that demonstrate the concepts in action, allowing readers to fully grasp the complexities associated with sustainable economic development Discusses how local administrators can balance the economic and environmental needs of the future Bridging the gap between policy-making intention and outcome, this book connects readers with a larger body of research that not only underpins practical applications but also helps them avoid legal, technical, and political obstacles. It provides an arsenal of best practices and everyday, easy-to-use strategies for optimizing the difficult balance between economic development and environmental protection.

Understanding Development: An Indian Perspective on Legal and Economic Policy (India Studies in Business and Economics) by Swapnendu Banerjee
English | 24 Sept. 2015 | ISBN: 813222454X, 8132234286 | 272 Pages | PDF (True) | 5.77 MB

This book addresses topical development issues in India, ranging from land acquisition, poverty alleviation programs, labor market issues, the public-private partnership (PPP) model and fiscal federalism. It offers an Indian perspective on the dynamics of economic development and the impact the country’s legal and public policies have on it. Economic development is a dynamic concept – old problems are solved, while at the same time new issues come to the fore. The emergence of these issues is unique to the development experience of an economy. The book includes sixteen recent contributions and is divided into four sections: law and contract; trade and foreign aid; issues in public economics; and the social sector and poverty alleviation. The chapters reflect on a number of development issues which were of concern for India in the recent past and will be important in her future development initiatives such as land acquisition, agricultural productivity, employment, protection of intellectual property rights, corruption, public-private partnership, regional development, poverty alleviations programs like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the training of self-help group members, health and education of women, to name a few. The book is a valuable reference resource for policy practitioners and researchers working on the economics of development with special focus on developing economies.

Judicial Sales of Ships: A Comparative Study (Hamburg Studies on Maritime Affairs) by Lief Bleyen
English | 25 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3319243748 | 220 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.24 MB

This work focuses on a specific aspect of the enforcement of maritime claims, namely judicial sales of ships, a procedure creditors typically resort to in the event of an irreversible default situation. A substantial part of the book approaches the topic from a comparative perspective, the goal being to assess the similarities and differences of the judicial sale procedure between three specific jurisdictions: Belgium, the Netherlands, and England & Wales. In this study, the comparison is used to further analyse the impacts of these differences on the effectiveness and reliability of the judicial sale procedure in each jurisdiction and also forms the basis for assessing the feasibility of harmonising judicial sale procedures and fostering their acceptance. Considering the international character typical of judicial sales of ships, conflict-of-law questions are very likely to arise during these procedures. Accordingly, the comparative study, where appropriate, is viewed against a private international law background.

Come ha scritto sul New York Times il columnist politico Jochen Bittner, "i leader europei dovrebbero ammettere che i cosiddetti euro-scettici hanno avuto spesso ragione, nel passato, e che è stato un errore bollarli come primitivi o reazionari eretici. Del resto, storicamente, gli eretici sono spesso stati coloro che alla fine hanno forzato un sistema di credenze a confrontarsi con le proprie contraddizioni. Lo stesso dovrebbe accadere all'interno dell'Unione Europea”.

Apocalypse Euro raccoglie alcune delle voci "eretiche" più importanti nel panorama europeo, a torto escluse dal racconto della crisi dal mainstream e oggi divenute, di conseguenza, il punto di riferimento per chi vuole trovare gli strumenti per uscire da questo "incubo”.

The Socio-Economic Evolution of the European Union: Exploring the Electronic Frontier
Springer | Economics | Aug. 5 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403036 | 128 pages | pdf | 1.4 mb

Authors: Mărcuț, Mirela
Explores the role of territory in the creation, maintenance and extension of the virtual space from a social and economic point of view
Examines the electronic frontier at a theoretical level using the European Union as a case study
Analyzes the evolution of the electronic frontier at a European level

This volume explores the role of territory in the creation, maintenance and extension of a new type of frontier, the electronic frontier, from a social and economic point of view. It departs from the earlier concepts of borders – state, social, economic, ethnic, religious, etc. – to investigate the fluidity of borders and their shift towards an axis-based paradigm within the free-movement European Union. Specifically, the authors will examine a) the metamorphoses of frontiers between the real and the virtual, b) the importance of space (territory) in the new information society and the Digital Single Market and c) the evolution of electronic frontiers in relation to globalization and the network society.
What happens when the Internet collides with new social and economic borders? In the past borders have been perceived from only a national state point of view. Now new types of borders or frontiers, such as social, economic, ethnic, religious frontiers, can be discussed. The electronic frontier is the result of a socio-economic analysis of the relationship between the Internet and new frontiers in society and the economy. The European space best represents the fluidity of borders and frontiers within this transformation. Thus, the European Union is the best space to perform research on the electronic frontiers. Borders are permeable or impermeable, agents of inclusiveness or of exclusion. The relations between the real space and the virtual space, but also the influence of the Internet on society, lead us to two other important concepts for our research, namely digital divide and digital inclusion, which define connections or barriers even within the virtual space.
This book attempts to answer questions such as:
What types of borders have information and communication technologies created in Europe?
Which is the foundation of these new frontiers?
How does the network society function in Europe and which type of frontier prevails?
This title aims to fill the gap in the literature in the relationship between frontiers and information and communication technologies.

Economics of Higher Education: Background, Concepts, and Applications by Robert K. Toutkoushian
English | 19 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 9401775044 | 404 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.23 MB

This book examines the many ways in which economic concepts, theories and models can be used to examine issues in higher education. The topics explored in the book include how students make college-going decisions, the payoffs to students and society from going to college, markets for higher education services, demand and supply in markets for higher education, why and how state and federal governments intervene in higher education markets, college and university revenues and expenditures, how institutions use net-pricing strategies and non-price product-differentiation strategies to pursue their goals and to compete in higher education markets, as well as issues related to faculty labor markets. The book is written for both economists and non-economists who study higher education issues and provides readers with background information and thorough explanations and illustrations of key economic concepts. In addition to reviewing the contributions economists have made to the study of higher education, it also examines recent research in each of the major topical areas. The book is policy-focused and each chapter analyses how contemporary higher education policies affect the behaviour of students, faculty and/or institutions of higher education. 

"Toutkoushian and Paulsen attempted a daunting task: to write a book on the economics of higher education for non-economists that is also useful to economists. A book that could be used for reference and as a textbook for higher education classes in economics, finance, and policy. They accomplish this tough balancing act with stunning success in a large volume that will serve as the go-to place for anyone interested in the history and current thinking on the economics of higher education.”

Handbook of Experimental Economic Methodology By Guillaume R. Fréchette, Andrew Schotter
2015 | 496 Pages | ISBN: 0195328329 | PDF | 3 MB


The Handbook of Experimental Economic Methodology, edited by Guillaume R. Fréchette and Andrew Schotter, aims to confront and debate the issues faced by the growing field of experimental economics. For example, as experimental work attempts to test theory, it raises questions about the proper relationship between theory and experiments. As experimental results are used to inform policy, the utility of these results outside the lab is questioned, and finally, as experimental economics tries to integrate ideas from other disciplines like psychology and neuroscience, the question of their proper place in the discipline of economics becomes less clear. This book contains papers written by some of the most accomplished scholars working at the intersection of experimental, behavioral, and theoretical economics talking about methodology. It is divided into four sections, each of which features a set of papers and a set of comments on those papers. The intention of the volume is to offer a place where ideas about methodology could be discussed and even argued. Some of the papers are contentious―-a healthy sign of a dynamic discipline―-while others lay out a vision for how the authors think experimental economics should be pursued. This exciting and illuminating collection of papers brings light to a topic at the core of experimental economics. Researchers from a broad range of fields will benefit from the exploration of these important questions.

Die Reform des steuerlichen Reisekostenrechts 2014 (Business, Economics, and Law) by Sarina Scheeler
German | 5 Jan. 2016 | ISBN: 3658120983 | 60 Pages | PDF (True) | 573.37 KB

Sarina Scheeler stellt die mit der Reform des steuerlichen Reisekostenrechts vorgenommenen gesetzlichen Änderungen übersichtlich dar und präzisiert die Unterschiede zur Rechtslage bis zum 31.12.2013. Sie setzt sich kritisch mit dem Begriff der ersten Tätigkeitsstätte in Bezug auf Gewinneinkünfte sowie mit den Auswirkungen der Reform auf die Unternehmenspraxis auseinander. Die Betrachtung der umfangreichen Änderungen zeigt, dass das steuerliche Reisekostenrecht auch künftig konfliktträchtig bleiben und die Gerichte beschäftigen wird. Die Ergebnisse offenbaren ferner, dass die Reform neben den vom Gesetzgeber angekündigten Vereinfachungen auch zu einer Verschärfung der Gesetzeslage geführt hat.

Le riforme a costo zero - Dieci proposte per tornare a crescere - Tito Boeri & Pietro Garibaldi
Italian | 2011 | 153 Pages | ISBN: 8861902308 | EPUB | 112.11 KB

Il ragionamento del "non ci sono i soldi per fare le riforme " apparentemente aristotelico e corretto - è invece profondamente sbagliato. Per due motivi, che sono alla base della decisione di scrivere questo libro. Il primo motivo è interno al ragionamento stesso. In Italia il vento della crescita non tornerà mai a spirare in poppa senza un vero e proprio programma di riforme. Il paese è praticamente fermo da quindici anni: tre quinquenni durante i quali l'economia mondiale è cresciuta come mai in passato. Nonostante la violenza della crisi globale, il 2009 è stato per il mondo solo una breve parentesi. Da noi invece sembra un incubo lungo vent'anni. Il vento della crescita soffia in varie parti del mondo, ma non tornerà mai a soffiare in Italia se non cambiamo atteggiamento. Il secondo errore nel ragionamento del "non ci sono i soldi" è invece un falso problema. Esistono moltissime e importantissime riforme che si possono fare "senza aumentare di un solo euro il debito pubblico". Sono le cosiddette Riforme a Costo Zero, il tema alla base di questo libro. In quasi tutti i campi cruciali dell'economia, è possibile cambiare le cose senza chiedere il conto a Pantalone: perché è vero che di soldi ce ne sono davvero pochi. Ma è anche vero che si possono fare importantissime riforme senza incidere sul bilancio pubblico. Richiedono solo di investire capitale politico nel cercare il consenso necessario. Una classe politica all'altezza può farcela. Gli ostacoli possono essere rimossi…

The Leap: How to Survive and Thrive in the Sustainable Economy by Chris Turner
English | 2012 | ISBN: 1611683718, 0307359239 | 372 pages | PDF | 1,3 MB

The crises in our economic system, our energy supply, and our climate are converging. Solving these crises requires a fundamental change in our frame of reference—a decisive shift not so much in technology as in technique. In The Leap, award-winning journalist Chris Turner presents a field guide to making the jump from our current system of energy supply and consumption to a sustainable model that succeeds across the socioeconomic spectrum. It is an integrated approach, one that he calls a “great leap sideways,” because it is a lateral leap that anyone can make: not escaping from, but moving toward.

Written with clarity and verve, The Leap draws on recent breakthroughs in state-of-the-art renewable energy, clean tech, and urban design to paint a picture of viable, sustainable economies that are already up and running, from Europe’s “green belt” to America’s “rust belt.” The leap Turner describes lands us in a place of reinvigorated community, renewed industrial might, and greater economic health and social well-being. He takes us there by exploring fascinating “great leaps” that have been made throughout history, and by tackling the biggest challenges we face now.

666 <--> Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective (Repost)
http://nitroflare.com/view/D9DDB99195F2EC7/0199374309_Financialspr.pdf


Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective By Nancy Morrow-Howell, Margaret Sherraden
2015 | 280 Pages | ISBN: 0199374309 | PDF | 13 MB


With today's availability of Social Security and Medicare, we typically think of the older years as a stage in life where people are supported financially. However, of the more than 40 million old adults currently living in the US, many are struggling financially living below or near the poverty line. They are lacking the assets necessary to see them through a period of life that is often longer than expected and that requires more health and long-term care. While financial vulnerability can be most pronounced in old age, it is often created across decades, revealing itself in later years when there is little opportunity to reverse a lifetime of disadvantage. The concept of Financial Capability refers to both an individual and structural idea that combines a person's ability to act with their opportunity to act in their best financial interests. In Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective the concept of Financial Capability is used to underscore the importance of acquiring knowledge and skills while also addressing policies and services than can build financial security. The volume assembles the latest evidence on financial capability and assets among older adults using a life course perspective, arguing that older adults need financial knowledge and financial services in order to build secure lives, and that this process needs to begin before it is too late to make effective changes and choices. Broken into three parts, the chapters in this book written by leading experts in the field blend together empirical findings, economic and social theory, and case studies. Part 1 opens the book with a conceptual and empirical overview of financial capability and assets among older adults using a life course perspective. Part 2 presents chapters addressing financial vulnerability of diverse racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and immigrants. Part 3 includes chapters describing current policies, programs, and innovations, including a review of important issues of working and caregiving in later life, and a detailed assessment of äge-friendly¨banking principles, banking products, services, and policies.

Finding a Voice at Work?: New Perspectives on Employment Relations By Stewart Johnstone, Peter Ackers
2015 | 336 Pages | ISBN: 0199668000 | PDF | 2 MB


How much 'say' should employees have in the running of business organizations, and what form should the 'voice' take? This is both the oldest and latest question in employment relations. Answers to these questions reflect our fundamental assumptions about the nature of the employment relationship, and inform our views on almost every aspect of Human Resource Management (HRM) and Employment Relations. Voice can also mean different things to different people. For some, employee voice is a synonym for trade union representation which aims to defend and promote the collective interests of workers. For others voice, is means of enhancing employee commitment and organisational performance. Others advocate workers control as an alternative to conventional capitalist organisations which are run for shareholders. There is thus both a moral and political argument for a measure of democracy at work, as well as a business case argument, which views voice as a potential link in the quest for increased organisational performance. The key debate for employment relations is which of the approaches 'works best' in delivering outcomes which balance competitiveness and productivity, on the one hand, and fair treatment of workers and social justice on the other. Policy makers need pragmatic answers to enduring questions: what works best in different contexts, what are the conditions of success, and what are the drawbacks? Some of the most significant developments in employee voice have taken place within the European Union, with various public policy and employer experiments attracting extensive academic research. The book offers a critical assessment of the main contemporary concepts and models of voice in the UK and Europe, and provides an in-depth theoretical and empirical exploration of employee voice in one accessible and cohesive collection.

668 <--> Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness: A Network Approach to Measurement and Monitoring (Repost)

Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness: A Network Approach to Measurement and Monitoring By Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz
2015 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0199338299 , 0199338302 | PDF | 20 MB


Connections among different assets, asset classes, portfolios, and the stocks of individual institutions are critical in examining financial markets. Interest in financial markets implies interest in underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. In Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness, Frank Diebold and Kamil Yilmaz propose a simple framework for defining, measuring, and monitoring connectedness, which is central to finance and macroeconomics. These measures of connectedness are theoretically rigorous yet empirically relevant. The approach to connectedness proposed by the authors is intimately related to the familiar econometric notion of variance decomposition. The full set of variance decompositions from vector auto-regressions produces the core of the 'connectedness table.' The connectedness table makes clear how one can begin with the most disaggregated pair-wise directional connectedness measures and aggregate them in various ways to obtain total connectedness measures. The authors also show that variance decompositions define weighted, directed networks, so that these proposed connectedness measures are intimately related to key measures of connectedness used in the network literature. After describing their methods in the first part of the book, the authors proceed to characterize daily return and volatility connectedness across major asset (stock, bond, foreign exchange and commodity) markets as well as the financial institutions within the U.S. and across countries since late 1990s. These specific measures of volatility connectedness show that stock markets played a critical role in spreading the volatility shocks from the U.S. to other countries. Furthermore, while the return connectedness across stock markets increased gradually over time the volatility connectedness measures were subject to significant jumps during major crisis events. This book examines not only financial connectedness, but also real fundamental connectedness. In particular, the authors show that global business cycle connectedness is economically significant and time-varying, that the U.S. has disproportionately high connectedness to others, and that pairwise country connectedness is inversely related to bilateral trade surpluses.

Lester M. Salamon, "New Frontiers of Philanthropy: A Guide to the New Tools and New Actors that Are Reshaping Global Philanthropy" 
English | ISBN: 0199357544 | 2014 | 768 pages | PDF | 7 MB

With the resources of both governments and traditional philanthropy barely growing or in decline, yet the problems of poverty, ill-health and environmental degradation ballooning daily, it is increasingly clear that new models for financing and promoting social and environmental objectives have become urgently needed. 

Fortunately, however, a significant revolution appears to be underway in the way in which social and environmental purposes are being financed. The heart of this revolution is a massive explosion in the instruments and institutions being deployed to mobilize private resources in support of social and environmental objectives. Where earlier such support was limited to charitable gifts, now a bewildering array of new instruments and institutions has surfaced-loans, loan guarantees, private equity, barter arrangements, social stock exchanges, bonds, secondary markets, investment funds, and many more-all of them designed to leverage not just the tens of billions of dollars of philanthropic grants but the hundreds of billions, indeed trillions, of dollars of private investment capital. 

While the changes under way are inspiring and by no means trivial, however, they remain largely uncharted in any systematic fashion. This monograph, and of the companion volume for which it also serves as the introductory chapter, is designed to overcome this problem, to provide the first comprehensible and accessible roadmap to the full range of important new developments taking place on the frontiers of philanthropy and social investment. In the process, it seeks to broaden awareness of these developments, increase their credence and traction, and make it possible to maximize the benefits they can generate while acknowledging the limitations and challenges they also face.

Dorothy Norris-Tirrell and Joy A. Clay, "Strategic Collaboration in Public and Nonprofit Administration: A Practice-Based Approach to Solving Shared Problems" 
English | ISBN: 1420088750 | 2010 | 417 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Market disruptions, climate change, and health pandemics lead the growing list of challenges faced by today’s leaders. These issues, along with countless others that do not make the daily news, require novel thinking and collaborative action to find workable solutions. However, many administrators stumble into collaboration without a strategic orientation. Using a practitioner-oriented style, Strategic Collaboration in Public and Nonprofit Administration: A Practice-Based Approach to Solving Shared Problems provides guidance on how to collaborate more effectively, with less frustration and better results. 


The authors articulate an approach that takes advantage of windows of opportunity for real problem solving; brings multi-disciplinary participants to the table to engage more systematically in planning, analysis, decision making, and implementation; breaks down barriers to change; and ultimately, lays the foundation for new thinking and acting. They incorporate knowledge gained from organization and collaboration management research and personal experience to create a fresh approach to collaboration practice that highlights:

Collaboration Lifecycle Model
Metric for determining why and when to collaborate
Set of principles that distinguish Strategic Collaboration Practice
Overall Framework of Strategic Collaboration


Linking collaboration theory to effective practice, this book offers essential advice that fosters shared understanding, creative answers, and transformation results through strategic collaborative action. With an emphasis on application, it uses scenarios, real-world cases, tables, figures, tools, and checklists to highlight key points. The appendix includes supplemental resources such as collaboration operating guidelines, a meeting checklist, and a collaboration literature review to help public and nonprofit managers successfully convene, administer, and lead collaboration. The book presents a framework for engaging in collaboration in a way that stretches current thinking and advances public service practice.

Glenn McGovern, "Protective Operations: A Handbook for Security and Law Enforcement"
English | ISBN: 1439851719 | 2011 | 224 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Protective Operations: A Handbook for Security and Law Enforcement is designed as a reference for law enforcement and security organizations tasked with protecting the welfare of an individual or groups of individuals. To be effective and professional, protective operations require the incorporation of a variety of skill sets. However, many departments and jurisdictions have only limited resources and training available. Filling this void, the book identifies issues particular to local law enforcement — and the private security teams that may be called in later — and offers suggestions and guidance for confronting high-threat scenarios as well as the more mundane protective details.

Highlights:


Details the essence of local law enforcement protective operations that are run, in large part, covertly 
Examines threat assessment from both hostile organizations and unknown adversaries
Provides a solid understanding of operational security, situational awareness, and surveillance detection
Includes examples from real-world attacks occurring over the past sixty years 
Reinforces the need for training in specific tactics and techniques
Emphasizes training for confronting the adversary
Focuses on the economics of providing the most protection for the least cost
Addresses issues surrounding possible direct violations of the law and department policy and procedures



The author’s decades of training, research, and experience provide invaluable tested and proven protocols for keeping subjects safe in a hostile environment.

Ian Dennis, "The Nature of Accounting Regulation" 
English | ISBN: 0415891957 | 2013 | 142 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Accounting standards are an essential element in the regulation of current financial reporting. Standard setters promulgate such standards, and companies and professional accountants follow them in preparing financial reports. Although much has been written about the history of standard setting, the conceptual underpinnings of accounting standards, the process of setting them, and whether such standards should be ‘rules-based’ or ‘principles-based,’ there has been little written about the kind of thing they are. This book examines the nature of accounting standards and the very idea of a rule, of implementation guidance, and of the objectives that are included in them. It enables the reader to grasp the reasons for promulgating standards, the role of the conceptual framework in setting standards in an institutional context, and the kind of rules that are useful in regulating financial reporting. The insights provided by this examination are used to throw light on the distinction between ‘principles-based’ and ‘rules-based’ standards and on the nature of ‘good’ accounting standards.'

Thomas C. Leonard, "Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era" 
2016 | ISBN: 0691169594 | 264 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Praised by the New York Times Book Review as a "vital account of the perils of intellectual arrogance," a troubling story of liberal economists, race, and eugenics In Illiberal Reformers, Thomas Leonard reexamines the economic progressives whose ideas and reform agenda underwrote the Progressive Era dismantling of laissez-faire and the creation of the regulatory welfare state, which, they believed, would humanize and rationalize industrial capitalism. But not for all. Academic social scientists such as Richard T. Ely, John R. Commons, and Edward A. Ross, together with their reform allies in social work, charity, journalism, and law, played a pivotal role in establishing minimum-wage and maximum-hours laws, workmen's compensation, progressive income taxes, antitrust regulation, and other hallmarks of the regulatory welfare state. But even as they offered uplift to some, economic progressives advocated exclusion for others, and did both in the name of progress. Leonard meticulously reconstructs the influence of Darwinism, racial science, and eugenics on scholars and activists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, revealing a reform community deeply ambivalent about America's poor. Economic progressives championed labor legislation because it would lift up the deserving poor while excluding immigrants, African Americans, women, and "mental defectives," whom they vilified as low-wage threats to the American workingman and to Anglo-Saxon race integrity. Economic progressives rejected property and contract rights as illegitimate barriers to needed reforms. But their disregard for civil liberties extended much further. Illiberal Reformers shows that the intellectual champions of the regulatory welfare state proposed using it not to help those they portrayed as hereditary inferiors, but to exclude them.

2008 | ISBN: 0307406199 | English | 251 pages | PDF+EPUB | 1 + 0.7 MB

Your Good Life Starts Now

Live beyond your means but spend within them.
Take your steady out for that $350 dinner after the big promotion. You might just have to eat PB&J for a week to make it happen.

Splurge when it makes sense.
Buy the designer jeans you can’t live without in your size, at full price. But you better walk away from last season’s must-have sweater, even if it is 75 percent off!

Make more money with your money. 
Invest in stocks to make the big bucks and start saving for retirement now. 
You want to be debt-free in your swinging sixties. 

Have it all . . . just not all at once.
Want a Mercedes more than anything in the world? You can make it happen . ..but probably not while sharing a summer beach house with your friends. 

Finally a savvy, realistic finance book for those of us who love our Starbucks mocha lattes and Razr cell phones but don’t want our Jimmy Choo shoes or Bose headphones buried under a pile of burgeoning debt. Twenty-something financial reporter Farnoosh Torabi tells you that you can satisfy your sophisticated tastes and achieve financial bliss. 

The key: prioritizing your expenses according to what you want the most—splurging when you can and saving on other things. From sensible grocery shopping (yes, you can have your organic yogurt and eat it, too!) to cyberbanking, empower yourself to live a guilt-free, Gucci- and gadget-clad good life without sacrificing financial security.

Springer | Economic Theory | April 25 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319284177 | 385 pages | pdf | 8.07 mb

Presents current insights, developments and trends in experimental economics
Features research in such areas as management science, decision theory, game theory, marketing and political science
Presents possibilities of using various computer methods in the scope of experimental economics
Merges findings and knowledge from various domains for the purposes of experimental economics

The aim of this volume is to provide deep insights and the latest scientific developments and trends in experimental economics. Derived from the 2015 Computational Methods in Experimental Economics (CMEE) conference, this book features papers containing research and analysis of economic experiments concerning research in such areas as management science, decision theory, game theory, marketing and political science. The goal is to present possibilities for using various computer methods in the scope of experimental economics to further provide researchers with a wide variety of tools. 
The field of experimental economics is rapidly evolving. Modern use of experimental economics requires the integration of knowledge in the domains of economic sciences, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience. Recent research includes experiments conducted both in the laboratory and in the field, and the results are used for testing and a better understanding of economic theories. Researchers working in this field use mainly a set of well-established methods and computer tools that support the experiments. Methods such as artificial intelligence, computer simulation and computer graphics, however, are not represented enough in experimental economics studies and most experimenters do not consider their usage. The goal of the conference and the enclosed papers is to allow for an exchange of experiences and to promote joint initiatives to insight change in this trend.

Economics of Immigration: The Impact of Immigration on the Australian Economy
Palgrave Macmillan | Labor Economics | Mar 9 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137555246 | 344 pages | pdf | 2.66 mb

Editors: Junankar, P. N. (Raja) (Ed.)

Poverty, famines, wars, and ethnic conflicts lead to large movements of refugees. The papers in this book provide an analysis of the economics of immigration. Junankar discusses why people migrate, the likely destinations for migrants, and their employment in the destination countries. He studies the benefits to the migrant families in terms of higher wages and living standards, and also studies how immigrants fare in the Australian labour markets in terms of finding good jobs, and whether there is discrimination against them. Economics of Immigration analyses the macroeconomic impacts of immigration on the Australian economy and discusses why some groups favour immigration while other groups are against it. Junankar argues immigration has been beneficial for employment and growth; not only adding to labour supply but also to labour demand, hence leading to favourable outcomes. This collection of essays shows how immigration has helped the economic development of Australia, while also highlighting that the historical reasons for immigration lie in the colonisation of many countries in Asia and Africa.

Empirical Evidence on the Macroeconomic Effects of EU Cohesion Policy
Springer Gabler | Public Finance | Jun 1, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3658138513 | 173 pages | pdf | 4.46 mb

Authors: Mohl, Philipp
Publication in the field of economic sciences

Philipp Mohl evaluates the macroeconomic effects of EU Cohesion Policy with the help of empirical methods. His findings indicate that in particular the part of EU Cohesion Policy which is spent for the poorest regions (the so-called Objective 1 funding) has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth. Moreover, the employment effects of EU Cohesion Policy seem to be conditional on the educational attainment, i.e., in particular regions with a high share of high-skilled population tend to benefit from EU funds. Finally, the author does not find evidence that EU funds significantly increase public investment in the EU countries, which points to a crowding out of national investment. Overall, the gained insights contribute to a more profound understanding of the macroeconomic effects of EU Cohesion Policy, which is essential to design an effective and efficient EU spending system.

Fred Yager, Jan Yager, "Idiot's Guides: Social Security"
ISBN: 1615647414 | 2015 | PDF | 304 pages | 9 MB

Along with Medicare, Social Security is one of the "rites of passage" as older Americans retire. After contributing funds to this program their entire working life, people are anxious to start getting their monthly checks. Following a brief look at why Social Security was established and what it is intended to provide, this easy-to-understand guide carefully and simply explains all the benefits and circumstances in which one can take advantage of Social Security. Coverage includes enrolling in Social Secuirty for disability and survival benefits, as well benefits from the traditional age-requirement. The book also has a decision tree to make perfectly clear what one's benefits are depending on such factors as how early one benefits are taken, marital status, and what one believes his or her future may hold. The future of Social Security is also explored and with that possible impacts on one's future benefits.

A daunting challenge to the international community is how to go about lifting the world's huge poor population out of poverty. "Asset-based" approaches to development are aimed specifically at designing and implementing public policies that will increase the capital assets of the poor —i.e., the physical, financial, human, social, and natural resources that can be acquired, developed, improved, and transferred across generations.

Più uguali più ricchi - Yoram Gutgeld
Italian | 2013 | 214 Pages | ISBN: 8817070564 | EPUB | 980.41 KB

Non abbiamo bisogno di manovre o aggiustamenti, quello che ci serve è un cambio di orizzonte mentale, un nuovo paradigma economico, sociale e politico che rompa con gli schemi del passato: analizzando le numerose occasioni perse dal nostro bipolarismo imperfetto negli ultimi vent'anni, Yoram Gutgeld dimostra in questa sua appassionata analisi che il declino del nostro Paese non è un processo irreversibile e che possiamo ancora tornare competitivi. Ma per ripartire dobbiamo subito accantonare una serie di luoghi comuni e alibi che non solo hanno impoverito il nostro dibattito politico, ma hanno oscurato i veri problemi che attanagliano il Paese. Dagli sprechi della pubblica amministrazione alle inefficienze della sanità, dalle occasioni mancate nel settore turistico alle buste paga dei lavoratori che devono assolutamente ricominciare a crescere, l'autore osserva le singole realtà italiane avanzando ogni volta proposte concrete, e spesso a costo zero, che permettano di superare le criticità. "Più uguali, più ricchi" racconta un Paese in cui la prima battaglia da vincere è proprio quella contro le iniquità che non sono solo all'origine dell'ingiustizia sociale, ma rappresentano anche un freno allo sviluppo economico. Portare l'equità al centro del dibattito politico non significa creare un Paese di uguali, ma uno in cui le imprese riescono a operare al meglio e le persone vengono premiate secondo le proprie capacità.

There is growing realization that there is no such thing as the national labour market, instead a mosaic of local and regional markets that differ in nature, performance and regulation.

Sie wünschen sich Erfolg - aber der will sich einfach nicht einstellen? Wenn Sie gerne erfolgreich wären, es aber Ihrer Meinung nach (noch) nicht sind, könnten Sie sich im Grunde davor fürchten und unbewusst Ihre eigenen Anstrengungen sabotieren. Immer wieder hält die meist unbewusste Furcht vor Veränderung Menschen davon ab, ihre ersehnten Ziele zu erreichen. Insbesondere die Angst vor dem Scheitern kann ihnen im Weg stehen. 

Dieses Buch hilft Ihnen, latente Ängste zu entlarven, sich ihnen zu stellen und sie zu überwinden. Sie erfahren, was Sie ganz konkret unternehmen können, um die angestrebten Ziele zu erreichen und wie Sie dabei Ihre eigene Erfolgsgeschichte schreiben.

ISBN: 1119267366 | 2016 | EPUB | 192 pages | 501 KB

Get your finances in order with smart budgeting and money mindfulness.

You Only Live Once is the guide to achieving your best life through smart money moves. Before you even begin making a budget, you need to think about why. Where do you see yourself financially in ten years? Five years? This time next year? What does money do for you? Once you know your destination, you can begin charting your course. Step-by-step guidance walks you through the budgeting process, and shows you how to plan your financial path to point toward your goals. You'll learn how to prioritize spending, how to save efficiently, and how to take advantage of simple tools you didn't know you had. Next comes the most important part: taking control. You need to really look at how you perceive and use money day-to-day. Chances are, changing a few habits could give you some breathing room and help you reach your goals sooner. 

You work hard for your money, yet there never seems to be enough. You don't need to live like a pauper, but you need to be truly aware of just where your money is going, and why. Financial awareness is the key to a financially secure future, and this book unpacks it all to help you get where you want to go.

Accept past decisions and articulate your financial goals
Align your lifestyle with your budget
Explore your relationship with money
Re-evaluate financial habits and behaviors

You know you need a budget, but you never seem to get around to doing it. Or maybe you did, but you can never seem to stick to it. Smart planning is a major factor in financial security, and it involves just as much introspection as math. You Only Live Once is more than a budgeting guide—it's a guide to revamping your financial behaviors to achieve the life you want.

Vandana Shiva, "Who Really Feeds the World?: The Failures of Agribusiness and the Promise of Agroecology" 
English | ISBN: 1623170621 | 2016 | 192 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Debunking the notion that our current food crisis must be addressed through industrial agriculture and genetic modification, author and activist Vandana Shiva argues that those forces are in fact the ones responsible for the hunger problem in the first place. Who Really Feeds the World? is a powerful manifesto calling for agricultural justice and genuine sustainability, drawing upon Shiva’s thirty years of research and accomplishments in the field. Instead of relying on genetic modification and large-scale monocropping to solve the world’s food crisis, she proposes that we look to agroecology—the knowledge of the interconnectedness that creates food—as a truly life-giving alternative to the industrial paradigm. Shiva succinctly and eloquently lays out the networks of people and processes that feed the world, exploring issues of diversity, the needs of small famers, the importance of seed saving, the movement toward localization, and the role of women in producing the world's food.

Ci prendono per fessi - L'economia della manipolazione e del'inganno - George A. Akerlof & Robert J. Shiller
Italian | 2016 | 335 Pages | ISBN: 8804663227 | EPUB | 681.2 KB

Fin dai tempi di Adam Smith, il pensiero economico ha tessuto le lodi del libero mercato che, quasi fosse governato da una mano invisibile, riuscirebbe a conciliare la ricerca dell'interesse personale con il benessere dell'intera società, trasformando il vantaggio individuale in bene comune. A questa concezione idilliaca lanciano una sfida radicale due premi Nobel dell'economia, George Akerlof e Robert Shiller, sostenendo che i mercati ci procurano tanti danni quanti benefici, e lungi dall'essere fondamentalmente benigni sono intrinsecamente disseminati di trappole e di esche cui finiamo per abboccare. Perché ogni volta che c'è un profitto da ricavare, i venditori non esiteranno a sfruttare le nostre debolezze psicologiche, la nostra superficialità e la nostra ignoranza per manipolarci e piazzarci la loro merce al prezzo più alto. È più che legittimo, quindi, applicare all'intero ambito dell'economia quella nozione di "phishing" nata fin dagli albori di Internet per definire il raggiro online, la "pesca degli ingenui" cui carpire informazioni, dati e, in definitiva, denaro. Ma mentre quella compiuta in Rete è un'azione illegale, un reato perseguito per legge, in economia è da sempre una pratica comune e indiscussa: raggirare ed essere raggirati è parte integrante dei rapporti fra gli attori del mercato. Per dimostrare la loro tesi, Akerlof e Shiller riportano una gran quantità di aneddoti ed episodi che rivelano come il phishing riguardi chiunque e ogni aspetto della nostra vita.

Paved with Good Intentions: Canada's Development NGOs on the Road from Idealism to Imperialism by Nik Barry-Shaw and Yves Engler
English | 2012 | ISBN: 155266399X | 128 pages | DJVU | 4,6 MB

NGOs are as Canadian as hockey, declared a 1988 Parliamentary report. Few institutions epitomize the foundational Canadian myth of international benevolence like the non-governmental organization devoted to development abroad. This book raises important questions about these organizations and their development projects: Just how non-governmental are organizations that get most of their funding from government agencies? What impact do these funding ties have on NGOs' ability to support popular demands for democratic reforms and wealth redistribution? What happens when NGOs support a repressive regime? What happens when NGOs bite the hand that feeds them?

Gregory T. Haugan, "The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios" 
English | ISBN: 1466505184 | 2012 | 420 pages | PDF | 5 MB

The ongoing changes in population, climate, and the availability of energy have resulted in unprecedented threats and opportunities that all project and program managers, portfolio managers, and public planners need to be aware of. The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios offers a clear look at how these constraints will impact project undertakings and overlay the current classic constraints of cost, schedule, and performance. 

The book provides current facts and information on population, climate change, and energy issues—identifying trends and outlining opportunities in the form of a set of overlays (summary conclusions). The overlays are indexed to current changes that collectively represent a major turning point in the way we use resources and our growing need to seek sustainability. Identifying how changes in the new triple constraints will impact long-range planning, the book: 

Explains the rationale behind population forecasts and the likely impact on global supply and demand 
Highlights emerging trends in global temperatures and sea level rise, and the impacts on ecology, biology, and the marine environment without political spin
Includes SWOT analyses of fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and renewable fuels to assist in planning programs that depends upon these energy sources
Provides expert estimates and forecasts of energy availability and alternatives
Discusses the risks of various energy options
Contains supporting Appendices and a comprehensive Bibliography

Most program life cycles last five to ten years, and infrastructure programs last 40 to 50 years; the text provides a rational basis for approaching the new problems that all program and portfolio managers will soon have to deal with. It will help you identify and recognize these current and projected circumstances and risks so you will understand and be prepared to make the most of the major changes impacting the upcoming decision environment.

Mindset: The New Psychology of Success By Carol S. Dweck
2008 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0345472322 | EPUB + MOBI | 3 MB


Mindset is one of those rare books that can help you make positive changes in your life and at the same time see the world in a new way. A leading expert in motivation and personality psychology, Carol Dweck has discovered in more than twenty years of research that our mindset is not a minor personality quirk: it creates our whole mental world. It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets. If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone–either you have them or you don’t. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity–and success. Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting. She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields–music, literature, science, sports, business–apply the growth mindset to achieve results. Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment. She looks across a broad range of applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. Highly engaging and very practical, Mindset breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.

Common Stocks and Common Sense: The Strategies, Analyses, Decisions, and Emotions of a Particularly Successful Value Investor by Edgar Wachenheim III
2016 | ISBN: 1119259606 | English | 224 pages | EPUB | 0.4 MB

Deep insight and candid discussion from one of Wall Street's best investors
Common Stocks and Common Sense provides detailed insight into common stock investing, using a case-study approach based on real-world investments. Author Edgar Wachenheim is the 28-year CEO of Greenhaven Associates, boasting an average annual portfolio comparable to Warren Buffet's. In this book, he shares his knowledge and experiences by providing detailed analyses of actual investments made by himself and other investors. The discussion covers the entire investment process, including the softer, human side, with candid insight into the joys and frustrations, intensities and pressures, and risks and uncertainties. The unique emphasis on behavioral economics and real-world cases set this book apart from the herd—but it's Wachenheim himself and his deeply-examined perspective that elevates the book beyond a mere investing guide.

Between 1990 and 2014, a typical portfolio managed by Wachenheim enjoyed an average annual return in excess of 18%, achieved using relatively conservative stocks and no financial leverage. As a proponent of evidence and example, his analysis of real cases serve as a valuable education for anyone looking to improve their own investment practices.

Understand investment through the lens of a Wall Street leader
Dig into the details of real-world common stock investing
Learn how to invest creatively and minimize risk
Go beyond theory to study strategy on a case-by-case basis
Investment principles and strategies are easy to find—entire libraries have been written about theories and methods and what 'should' happen. But this book goes beyond the typical guide to show you how these ideas are applied in the real world—and what actually happened. Investors seeking real insight, real expertise, and a proven track record will find Common Stocks and Common Sense a uniquely useful resource.

German | 17 Jan. 2016 | ISBN: 3658121092 | 116 Pages | PDF (True) | 1017.27 KB

Die Arbeit untersucht den Einfluss des psychologischen Persönlichkeitskonstrukts der Dunklen Triade, bestehend aus Narzissmus, Psychopathie und Machiavellismus, auf die Strategien der Emotionsarbeit sowie der daraus resultierenden positiven und negativen Konsequenzen für Angestellte im Dienstleistungssektor. Die Daten einer hierfür konzipierten Online-Befragung von 255 Dienstleistungsmitarbeitern zeigen, dass Psychopathen und Narzissten Oberflächenhandeln nutzen, um ihre Emotionen in der Interaktion mit Kunden zu regulieren. Letztere wenden auch die Strategie des Tiefenhandelns an. Zudem bestätigen die Befunde, dass Oberflächenhandeln den Einfluss der Dunklen Triade auf Erschöpfung vermittelt, wobei Tiefenhandeln als partieller Mediator in der Beziehung von Narzissmus und Engagement fungiert. Engagement erhöht in der Folge die Zufriedenheit und Leistung des Angestellten.

715 <--> The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism
http://nitroflare.com/view/B40549634EDB555/0262034573.pdf


The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism (MIT Press) by Arun Sundararajan
2016 | ISBN: 0262034573 | English | 256 pages | PDF | 6 MB

Sharing isn't new. Giving someone a ride, having a guest in your spare room, running errands for someone, participating in a supper club – these are not revolutionary concepts. What is new, in the "sharing economy," is that you are not helping a friend for free; you are providing these services to a stranger for money. In this book, Arun Sundararajan, an expert on the sharing economy, explains the transition to what he describes as "crowd-based capitalism" – a new way of organizing economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model. As peer-to-peer commercial exchange blurs the lines between the personal and the professional, how will the economy, government regulation, what it means to have a job, and our social fabric be affected?

Drawing on extensive research and numerous real-world examples – including Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Etsy, TaskRabbit, France's BlaBlaCar, China's Didi Kuaidi, and India's Ola, Sundararajan explains the basics of crowd-based capitalism. He describes the intriguing mix of "gift" and "market" in its transactions, demystifies emerging blockchain technologies, and clarifies the dizzying array of emerging on-demand platforms. He considers how this new paradigm changes economic growth and the future of work. Will we live in a world of empowered entrepreneurs who enjoy professional flexibility and independence? Or will we become disenfranchised digital laborers scurrying between platforms in search of the next wedge of piecework? Sundararajan highlights the important policy choices and suggests possible new directions for self-regulatory organizations, labor law, and funding our social safety net.

From Big Data to Big Profits: Success with Data and Analytics By Russell Walker
2015 | 312 Pages | ISBN: 0199378320 | PDF | 3 MB


Vast holdings and assessment of consumer data by large companies are not new phenomena. Firms' ability to leverage the data to reach customers in targeted campaigns and gain market share is, and on an unprecedented scale. Major companies have moved from serving as data or inventory storehouses, suppliers, and exchange mechanisms to monetizing their data and expanding the products they offer. Such changes have implications for both firms and consumers in the coming years. In Success with Big Data, Russell Walker investigates the use of internal Big Data to stimulate innovations for operational effectiveness, and the ways in which external Big Data is developed for gauging, or even prompting, customer buying decisions. Walker examines the nature of Big Data, the novel measures they create for market activity, and the payoffs they can offer from the connectedness of the business and social world. With case studies from Apple, Netflix, Google, and Amazon, Walker both explores the market transformations that are changing perceptions of Big Data, and provides a framework for assessing and evaluating Big Data. Although the world appears to be moving toward a marketplace where consumers will be able to "pull" offers from firms, rather than simply receiving offers, Walker observes that such changes will require careful consideration of legal and unspoken business practices as they affect consumer privacy. Rigorous and meticulous, Success with Big Data is a valuable resource for graduate students and professionals with an interest in Big Data, digital platforms, and analytics.

Management Gurus and Management Fashions by Brad Jackson
English | Apr. 28, 2001 | ISBN: 0415249465, 0415249457 | 225 Pages | PDF | 1 MB

Since the 1980s, popular management thinkers, ‘gurus’, have promoted a number of performance improvement programs and management fashions which have greatly influenced both the everyday conduct of organizational life and the preoccupations of academic researchers. This book provides a rhetorical critique of the management guru and management fashion phenomenon, building on the important theoretical progress that has recently been made by a small, but growing band of management researchers.
Fantasy theme analysis, a dramatically-based method of rhetorical criticism, is conducted to critique three of the most important management fashions to have emerged during the 1990s:
* the re-engineering movement promoted by Michael Hammer and James Champy
* the effectiveness movement led by Stephen Covey
* the learning organization movement inspired by Peter Senge and his colleagues.
In addition to its rhetorical and empirical contributions, this book stimulates a much-needed critical dialogue between practitioners and academics on the sources of the underlying appeal of management gurus and management fashions, and their effect upon the quality of management and organizational learning.

Globalization and the Race to the Bottom in Developing Countries: Who Really Gets Hurt? by Nita Rudra
English | Oct. 13, 2008 | ISBN: 0521715032, 0521886988 | 316 Pages | PDF | 2 MB

The advance of economic globalization has led many academics, policy-makers, and activists to warn that it leads to a 'race to the bottom'. In a world increasingly free of restrictions on trade and capital flows, developing nations that cut public services are risking detrimental effects to the populace. Conventional wisdom suggests that it is the poorer members of these societies who stand to lose the most from these pressures on welfare protections, but this new study argues for a more complex conceptualization of the subject. Nita Rudra demonstrates how and why domestic institutions in developing nations have historically ignored the social needs of the poor; globalization neither takes away nor advances what never existed in the first place. It has been the lower- and upper-middle classes who have benefited the most from welfare systems and, consequently, it is they who are most vulnerable to globalization's race to the bottom.

This book investigates the recent rise of the market-oriented value chain approach in development policy with a focus on the agro-export sector in the Global South. The research project aims at unveiling the political, social and cultural processes around the circulation of market rationales at the global scale and on the ground. In-depth analyses of two exemplary settings, Peru and Ghana, reveal the extent to which national policies, development programs, laws and academic curricula have adopted a "thinking in terms of value chains" in the last decade. By embracing the perspectives of policymakers, consultants, entrepreneurs and producers, this book provides exciting first-hand insights about the making of markets for scholars and development practitioners alike.

Unter Verwendung einer experimentellen Studie zeigt Markus Gahler, dass Konsumenten in internetbasierten PWYW-Situationen durchaus bereit sind positive Preise zu zahlen. Die Ergebnisse seiner regressionsbasierten Modellschätzung verdeutlichen, dass bei geltender Käuferanonymität die freiwillige Zahlungsbereitschaft durch einen vom Verkäufer kommunizierten externen Referenzpreis positiv beeinflusst wird. Dieser Effekt wird bei Gütern mit niedrigen variablen Kosten über das soziale Motiv der Fairness mediiert.

Unternehmensfitness: 'raus aus dem Mittelmaß!: Systematisches Training von Arbeits- und Verhaltensweisen für nachhaltigen Erfolg by Volkmar Völzke
German | 27 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658087498 | 179 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

Dieses neuartige Fitnessbuch für unternehmerische Leistungssteigerung gibt allen Managern und Geschäftsleitern konkrete und erprobte Trainingspläne an die Hand, die sie direkt in ihrem Unternehmen oder ihrer Abteilung umsetzen können – mit garantiert positivem Effekt auf die nachhaltige Leistungsfähigkeit der Mitarbeiter.

Denn nachhaltiger unternehmerischer Erfolg muss genauso wie im Spitzensport systematisch trainiert werden, und zwar in allen Dimensionen wie zum Beispiel Führung, Kundenfokus, Begeisterung der Mannschaft und operative Leistungsfähigkeit.

Die meisten Manager, Teams und Unternehmen bleiben aber weit unter Ihren Möglichkeiten, weil sie Erfolg zu sehr an äußere Umstände koppeln anstatt an die verborgenen Kräfte im eigenen Unternehmen. Genau wie die besten Mannschaften im Spitzensport sind auch die dauerhaft erfolgreichsten Unternehmen nicht durch „glückliche Umstände“ dauerhaft an der Spitze, sondern, weil sie alle entscheidenden Potenziale systematisch trainieren.

Redefining Well-Being in Nations and Organizations: A Process of Improvement by Qassim Jawad Ali
English | 14 Jan. 2014 | ISBN: 1349847992, 1137572442 | 233 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.04 MB

Redefining Well-Being in Nations and Organizations is an essential book for researchers, policy makers and managers. It provides a new multi-disciplinary perspective on wellbeing and engagement, reviewing the latest research from several previously unrelated disciplines to develop a process for active committed enthusiasm (PACE), encompassing theory and clarifying the definitions of, and relationships between, wellbeing, engagement and related concepts. PACE allows researchers to model causal relationships, and policy makers and managers to analyze the potential impact of possible interventions. It demonstrates that, as nations, organizations and individuals fulfil their basic material needs, the impact of individual optimism, and other aspects of positive psychology, become paramount in maximizing wellbeing and engagement.

Frackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment by Wenonah Hauter
2016 | ISBN: 1620970074 | English | 384 pages | PDF | 9 MB

Over the past decade a new and controversial energy extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has rocketed to the forefront of U.S. energy production. With fracking, millions of gallons of water, dangerous chemicals, and sand are injected under high pressure deep into the earth, fracturing hard rock to release oil and gas.

Wenonah Hauter, one of the nation’s leading public interest advocates, argues that the rush to fracking is dangerous to the environment and treacherous to human health. Frackopoly describes how the fracking industry began; the technologies that make it possible; and the destruction and poisoning of clean water sources and the release of harmful radiation from deep inside shale deposits, creating what the author calls sacrifice zones” across the American landscape.

The book also examines the powerful interests that have supported fracking, including leading environmental groups, and offers a thorough debunking of its supposed economic benefits. With a wealth of new data, Frackopoly is essential and riveting reading for anyone interested in protecting the environment and ensuring a healthy and sustainable future for all Americans.

Springer | Business & Management | July 8 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319389734 | 318 pages | pdf | 5.86 mb

Editors: D'Ascenzo, F., Magni, M., Lazazzara, A., Za, S. (Eds.)
Highlights a collection of multidisciplinary contributions in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation
Presents an overview of the research methods currently applied by the broader community of IS scholars
Outlines the most relevant research topics in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation

This book examines the impact of digital innovation on organizations. It reveals how the digital revolution is redefining traditional levels of analysis while at the same time blurring the internal and external boundaries of the organizational environment. It presents a collection of research papers that examine the interaction between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and behavior from a threefold perspective: First, they analyze individual behavior in terms of specific organizational practices like learning, collaboration and knowledge transfer, as well as the use of ICT within the organization. Second, they explore the dynamics at work on the border between the internal and the external environments by analyzing the organizational impact of ICT usage outside the company, as can be seen in employer branding, consumer behavior and organizational image. Third, they investigate how ICT is being adopted to help face societal challenges outside the company like waste and pollution, smart cities, and e-government. 
The diversity of views offered makes this book particularly relevant for users, companies, scientists and governments. The content is based on a selection of the best papers – original double-blind peer reviewed contributions –presented at the annual conference of the Italian chapter of AIS, which took place in Rome, Italy, in October 2015, or in other reputable international peer-refereed Information Systems conferences.

Greek Capitalism in Crisis: Marxist Analyses by Stavros Mavroudeas
English | 2014 | ISBN: 041574492X | 262 pages | PDF | 1,2 MB

Despite the depth of the Greek crisis, the exorbitant burdens placed upon the working people and the massive popular resistance movement to capitalist policies, there is a definite lack of consistently Marxist analyses of the Greek problem. International debates regarding the Greek crisis have been dominated by orthodox (Neoclassical and neo-Keynesian) approaches.

The heterodox side of these debates has been occupied by Radical Political Economy approaches (usually radical post-Keynesian or Marxo-Keynesian perspectives). Moreover, they are dominated by the ‘financialisation’ thesis which is quite alien to Marxism, neglects the sphere of production and professes that the global crisis is simply a financial crisis that has nothing to do with ‘real’ accumulation and the profit rate.

This book argues that by emphasising the sphere of production and profitability, classical Marxist analysis better explains the Greek crisis than its orthodox and heterodox competitors. The contributors present critiques of the prevalent approaches and offer studies of the Greek crisis that use the methodology and the analytical and empirical tools of classical Marxist Political Economy. In particular, it is shown that the Greek crisis was caused by falling profitability and the ensuing overaccumulation crisis. The ‘broad unequal exchange’ existing between the euro-center and the euro-periphery contributed to Greek capital’s falling profitability. This book enriches the debate about the Greek economic crisis by demonstrating the insights that can be drawn by considering the Marxist alternative to the dominant mainstream and heterodox approaches.

While financial systems are a key factor in economic growth, there is still surprisingly little agreement about how to define and measure their development. To address this gap, the World Economic Forum has undertaken a research initiative aimed at providing business leaders and policymakers with a common framework to identify and discuss the key factors in the development of global financial systems and markets.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction: The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism by Daniel E. Saros
English | 2014 | ISBN: 0415742927 | 292 pages | PDF | 1 MB

The failure of command central planning in the twentieth century has led to a general disillusionment within the socialist movement worldwide. Some alternatives to capitalism have been proposed since the end of the Cold War, but none has offered an alternative form of economic calculation. 

This book explains how modern information technology may be used to implement a new method of economic calculation that could bring an end to capitalism and make socialism possible.

In this book, the author critically examines a number of socialist proposals that have been put forward since the end of the Cold War. It is shown that although these proposals have many merits, their inability effectively to incorporate the benefits of information technology into their models has limited their ability to solve the problem of socialist construction. The final section of the book proposes an entirely new model of socialist development, based on a "needs profile" that makes it possible to convert the needs of large numbers of people into data that can be used as a guide for resource allocation. This analysis makes it possible to rethink and carefully specify the conditions necessary for the abolition of capital and consequently the requirements for socialist revolution and, ultimately, communist society.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction will be of interest to students and scholars of political economy, the history of economic thought, labour economics and industrial economics.

736 <--> Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics
http://nitroflare.com/view/F90EB0CEB4654F0/0873896483.pdf


James L Lamprecht, "Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics" 
2005 | ISBN-10: 0873896483 | 304 pages | PDF | 2 MB

With the rise of Six Sigma, the use of statistics to analyze and improve processes has once again regained a prominent place in businesses around the world. An increasing number of employees and managers, bestowed with the titles Green Belt, Black Belt, or even Master Black Belts, are asked to apply statistical techniques to analyze and resolve industrial and non-industrial (also known as transactional) problems. These individuals are continuously faced with the daunting task of sorting out the vast array of sophisticated techniques placed at their disposal by an equally impressive array of statistical computer software packages. 

This book is intended for the ever-growing number of certified Black Belts as well as uncertified others that would like to understand how data can be analyzed. Many courses, including Six Sigma Black Belt courses, do a good job introducing participants to a vast array of sophisticated statistical techniques in as little as ten days, leaning heavily on statistical software packages. Although it is true that one can simplify statistical principles, learning how to interpret results produced by any statistical software requires the understanding of statistics that this book concisely provides. 

Benefits: 

Numerous examples illustrate how various techniques are applied. 

Each example is reviewed from the perspective of what was not said in the example; in other words, the very information you will be faced with when you conduct your own analysis. 

Titles of some sections in the book include the word optional or advanced. These sections cover more advanced but nonetheless useful topics, but skipping these sections will not affect the overall flow of the various subjects presented.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks (Financial Markets and Investments) by H. Kent Baker and Greg Filbeck
English | 2015 | ISBN: 0199375879 | 624 pages | PDF | 5 MB

During the past few decades, private equity (PE) has attracted considerable attention from investors, practitioners, and academicians. In fact, a substantial literature on PE has emerged. PE offers benefits for institutional and private wealth management clients including diversification and enhancement of risk-adjusted returns. However, several factors such as liquidity concerns, regulatory restrictions, and the lack of transparency limit the attractiveness of some PE options to investors. The latest volume in the Financial Markets and Investments Series, Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks offers a synthesis of the theoretical and empirical literature on PE in both emerging and developed markets. Editors H. Kent Baker, Greg Filbeck, Halil Kiymaz and their co-authors examine PE and provide important insights about topics such as major types of PE (venture capital, leveraged buyouts, mezzanine capital, and distressed debt investments), how PE works, performance and measurement, uses and structure, and trends in the market. Readers can gain an in-depth understanding about PE from academics and practitioners from around the world.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks provides a fresh look at the intriguing yet complex subject of PE. A group of experts takes readers through the core topics and issues of PE, and also examines the latest trends and cutting-edge developments in the field. The coverage extends from discussing basic concepts and their application to increasingly complex and real-world situations. This new and intriguing examination of PE is essential reading for anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of PE, from seasoned professionals to those aspiring to enter the demanding world of finance.

Sie analysiert sowohl soziale Determinanten, wie die Anzahl der Geschwister, die Familienkonstellation und insbesondere die soziale Herkunft, als auch institutionelle Einflussfaktoren, wie Studienfinanzierungsmodelle, Studiengebühren oder auch Zulassungsbeschränkungen. Die unterschiedlichen Aspekte der Fragestellung werden anhand eigens erhobener Umfragedaten in Thüringen sowie der Datensätze des NEPS und des Studierendensurveys in 11 Wellen untersucht. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die Studienwahl viel weniger vom eigenen Willen geprägt ist, als man annehmen mag.

When the Money Runs Out: The End of Western Affluence by Stephen D. King
English | 2013 | ISBN: 0300190522, 0300205236 | 304 pages | EPUB | 0,4 MB

The Western world has experienced extraordinary economic progress throughout the last six decades, a prosperous period so extended that continuous economic growth has come to seem normal. But such an era of continuously rising living standards is a historical anomaly, economist Stephen D. King warns, and the current stagnation of Western economies threatens to reach crisis proportions in the not-so-distant future.

Praised for the “dose of realism” he provided in his book Losing Control, King follows up in this volume with a plain-spoken assessment of where the West stands today. It’s not just the end of an age of affluence, he shows. We have made promises to ourselves that are achievable only through ongoing economic expansion. The future benefits we expect—pensions, healthcare, and social security, for example—may be larger than tomorrow’s resources. And if we reach that point, which promises will be broken and who will lose out? The lessons of history offer compelling evidence that political and social upheaval are often born of economic stagnation. King addresses these lessons with a multifaceted plan that involves painful—but necessary—steps toward a stable and just economic future.

Consumer Energy Conservation Behavior After Fukushima: Evidence from Field Experiments (SpringerBriefs in Economics) by Isamu Matsukawa
English | 23 May 2016 | ISBN: 981101096X | 120 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.45 MB

This book presents an in-depth empirical analysis of consumer response to alternative policies for energy conservation. Its main focus is on innovative policy instruments that have attracted increasing attention from academics and energy conservation practitioners alike: critical peak pricing, conservation requests, in-home displays, and home energy reports. The book investigates the effects of these policy instruments on residential demand for electricity. The data is drawn from a series of randomized field experiments for the years 2012–2013 in Japan, where serious concerns about power shortages have emerged in the wake of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. By applying econometric techniques to the quantitative analysis of residential power consumption, the book demonstrates how consumers respond to innovative instruments for energy conservation. It also offers new perspectives on how these instruments can be used more effectively and explores the potential for their practical implementation. This highly informative book is essential reading for energy specialists in both academic and professional contexts.

Employer Branding für KMU: Die Bedeutung internationaler Kontakte bei der Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften (BestMasters) by David Vinzenz Hanußek
German | 24 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3658118342 | 184 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.32 MB

David Hanußek erforscht die Bedeutung von internationalen Kontakten und die Kreation einer Arbeitgebermarke für die Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften in kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU). Auf Grundlage von Umfragen bei Arbeitgebern in der Region Nordschwarzwald zeigt er, dass die Attraktivität eines Arbeitgebers vor allem von dessen Flexibilität in der Gestaltung des Arbeitsumfeldes und dessen Innovationsfähigkeit abhängt. Gerade KMU haben oft nicht die Mittel, sich mit einer Arbeitgebermarke auch international richtig zu positionieren. Im Wettbewerb um Arbeitskräfte ist daher die Region entscheidend: Politik, Tourismus- und Stadtmarketing, Industrie-, Handels- sowie Handwerkskammern sollten hier Hand in Hand arbeiten, um über die Region und die Gesamtheit der Unternehmen auch das einzelne Unternehmen attraktiv zu machen.

Personalgewinnung in Zeiten des Fachkräftemangels: Quereinsteiger als potenzielle Kandidaten entdecken by Sylvia Knecht
German | 3 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658131632 | 180 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.33 MB

Dieses Buch zeigt, dass Quereinsteiger für Unternehmen bisher wenig erkannte Leistungsbringer sein können. In Politik und im Ehrenamt sind sie bereits an der Tagesordnung. In der Wirtschaft fehlt es aber nach wie vor an Mut, Wissen und Können, Bewerber unabhängig von bisher erbrachten Leistungsnachweisen zu beurteilen.

Die Autorin zeigt auf, warum sich dies ändern muss, welche Chancen sich bieten, wenn grundlegend neue Denkmuster zugelassen werden und wie man Quereinsteiger in Bewerbungsverfahren aktiv anspricht.

Und umgekehrt müssen sich die Quereinsteiger auch auf die Belange der Unternehmen einlassen. Getreu dem Motto: Der Kunde kauft nur, was er braucht, muss alles optimal auf die Bedürfnisse der potenziellen ‚Kundschaft‘ ausgerichtet werden. Dazu finden sich praktische Tipps und Anregungen, die helfen, schneller ins Unternehmen einzusteigen. 

Rund 1,2 Millionen Menschen wagen jährlich in Deutschland den Sprung in die berufliche Neuorientierung. Diese Quereinsteiger überzeugen durch neue Denkansätze, Motivation und Eigeninitiative.

· Quereinsteiger richtig rekrutieren: Tipps und Tricks für die Personalabteilung

The Himalayan Border Region: Trade, Identity and Mobility in Kumaon, India (Advances in Asian Human-Environmental Research) by Christoph Bergmann
English | 5 May 2016 | ISBN: 3319297058 | 208 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.98 MB

Drawing from extensive archival work and long-term ethnographic research, this book focuses on the so-called Bhotiyas, former trans-Himalayan traders and a Scheduled Tribe of India who reside in several high valleys of the Kumaon Himalaya. The area is located in the border triangle between India, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR, People’s Republic of China), and Nepal, where contestations over political boundaries have created multiple challenges as well as opportunities for local mountain communities. Based on an analytical framework that is grounded in and contributes to recent advances in the field of border studies, the author explores how the Bhotiyas have used their agency to develop a flourishing trans-Himalayan trade under British colonial influence; to assert an identity and win legal recognition as a tribal community in the political setup of independent India; and to innovate their pastoral mobility in the context of ongoing state and market reforms. By examining the Bhotiyas’ trade, identity and mobility this book shows how and why the Himalayan border region has evolved as an agentive site of political action for a variety of different actors.
