Stochastic Analysis for Finance with Simulations
Springer | Mathematics | August 14, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319255878 | 657 pages | pdf | 11.96 mb

Authors: Choe, Geon Ho
Presents the mathematical methods required for pricing financial derivatives
Encourages hands-on experience and builds intuition by explaining theoretical concepts with computer simulations
Covers mathematical prerequisites, including measure theory, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations

This book is an introduction to stochastic analysis and quantitative finance; it includes both theoretical and computational methods. Topics covered are stochastic calculus, option pricing, optimal portfolio investment, and interest rate models. Also included are simulations of stochastic phenomena, numerical solutions of the Black–Scholes–Merton equation, Monte Carlo methods, and time series. Basic measure theory is used as a tool to describe probabilistic phenomena. 
The level of familiarity with computer programming is kept to a minimum. To make the book accessible to a wider audience, some background mathematical facts are included in the first part of the book and also in the appendices. This work attempts to bridge the gap between mathematics and finance by using diagrams, graphs and simulations in addition to rigorous theoretical exposition. Simulations are not only used as the computational method in quantitative finance, but they can also facilitate an intuitive and deeper understanding of theoretical concepts. 
Stochastic Analysis for Finance with Simulations is designed for readers who want to have a deeper understanding of the delicate theory of quantitative finance by doing computer simulations in addition to theoretical study. It will particularly appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics and business, but not excluding practitioners in finance industry.

302 <--> Time Series Econometrics
http://nitroflare.com/view/5668AF6F875C47A/3319328611.pdf
https://filejoker.net/goocppqbapgy


Klaus Neusser, "Time Series Econometrics" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319328611 | 409 pages | PDF | 6 MB

This text presents modern developments in time series analysis and focuses on their application to economic problems. The book first introduces the fundamental concept of a stationary time series and the basic properties of covariance, investigating the structure and estimation of autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models and their relations to the covariance structure. The book then moves on to non-stationary time series, highlighting its consequences for modeling and forecasting and presenting standard statistical tests and regressions. Next, the text discusses volatility models and their applications in the analysis of financial market data, focusing on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models. The second part of the text devoted to multivariate processes, such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models, which have become the main tools in empirical macroeconomics. The text concludes with a discussion of co-integrated models and the Kalman Filter, which is being used with increasing frequency. Mathematically rigorous, yet application-oriented, this self-contained text will help students develop a deeper understanding of theory and better command of the models that are vital to the field. Assuming a basic knowledge of statistics and/or econometrics, this text is best suited for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

Realistic Simulation of Financial Markets: Analyzing Market Behaviors by the Third Mode of Science
Springer | Economics | August 7, 2016 | ISBN-10: 4431550569 | 197 pages | pdf | 7.42 mb

Editors: Kita, Hajime, Taniguchi, Kazuhisa, Nakajima, Yoshihiro (Eds.)
Presents the ultra-realistic artificial market simulator U-Mart that can simulate “arrowhead” in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other markets
Draws on more than 10 years of academic experiments to create a unique educational tool
Introduces a new approach for interdisciplinary research bringing together economics and engineering

This book takes up unique agent-based approaches to solving problems related to stock and their derivative markets. Toward this end, the authors have worked for more than 15 years on the development of an artificial market simulator called U-Mart for use as a research and educational tool. A noteworthy feature of the U-Mart simulator compared to other artificial market simulators is that U-Mart is an ultra-realistic artificial stock and their derivative market simulator. For example, it can simulate “arrowhead,” a next-generation trading system used in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other major markets, as it takes into consideration the institutional design of the entire market. Another interesting feature of the U-Mart simulator is that it permits both human and computer programs to participate simultaneously as traders in the artificial market. In this book, first the details of U-Mart are explained, enabling readers to install and run the simulator on their computers for research and educational purposes. The simulator thus can be used for gaming simulation of the artificial market and even for users as agents to implement their own trading strategies for agent-based simulation (ABS).The book also presents selected research cases using the U-Mart simulator. Here, topics include automated acquisition of trading strategy using artificial intelligence techniques, evaluation of a market maker system to treat thin markets such as those for small and regional businesses, systemic risk analysis of the financial market considering institutional design of the market, and analysis of how humans behave and learn in gaming simulation. New perspectives on artificial market research are provided, and the power, potential, and challenge of ABS are discussed. As explained in this important work, ABS is considered to be an effective tool as the third approach of social science, an alternative to traditional literary and mathematical approaches.

Sie wünschen sich Erfolg - aber der will sich einfach nicht einstellen? Wenn Sie gerne erfolgreich wären, es aber Ihrer Meinung nach (noch) nicht sind, könnten Sie sich im Grunde davor fürchten und unbewusst Ihre eigenen Anstrengungen sabotieren. Immer wieder hält die meist unbewusste Furcht vor Veränderung Menschen davon ab, ihre ersehnten Ziele zu erreichen. Insbesondere die Angst vor dem Scheitern kann ihnen im Weg stehen. 

Dieses Buch hilft Ihnen, latente Ängste zu entlarven, sich ihnen zu stellen und sie zu überwinden. Sie erfahren, was Sie ganz konkret unternehmen können, um die angestrebten Ziele zu erreichen und wie Sie dabei Ihre eigene Erfolgsgeschichte schreiben.

"…ein äußerst informativer und kompakt geschriebener Ratgeber, der einem hilft, die Steine des Misserfolgs, die in der eigenen Psyche oft genug den Weg versperren, beiseite zu räumen."

Mag. Adam Silye, Künstler

"Sehr gründlich und gut recherchiert, ohne dabei belehrend zu wirken. Das Buch motiviert sehr, sich mit der Thematik auseinanderzusetzen und daraus für sich persönlich eine Lehre zu ziehen."

ISBN: 1119267366 | 2016 | EPUB | 192 pages | 501 KB

Get your finances in order with smart budgeting and money mindfulness.

You Only Live Once is the guide to achieving your best life through smart money moves. Before you even begin making a budget, you need to think about why. Where do you see yourself financially in ten years? Five years? This time next year? What does money do for you? Once you know your destination, you can begin charting your course. Step-by-step guidance walks you through the budgeting process, and shows you how to plan your financial path to point toward your goals. You'll learn how to prioritize spending, how to save efficiently, and how to take advantage of simple tools you didn't know you had. Next comes the most important part: taking control. You need to really look at how you perceive and use money day-to-day. Chances are, changing a few habits could give you some breathing room and help you reach your goals sooner. 

You work hard for your money, yet there never seems to be enough. You don't need to live like a pauper, but you need to be truly aware of just where your money is going, and why. Financial awareness is the key to a financially secure future, and this book unpacks it all to help you get where you want to go.

Accept past decisions and articulate your financial goals
Align your lifestyle with your budget
Explore your relationship with money
Re-evaluate financial habits and behaviors

You know you need a budget, but you never seem to get around to doing it. Or maybe you did, but you can never seem to stick to it. Smart planning is a major factor in financial security, and it involves just as much introspection as math. You Only Live Once is more than a budgeting guide—it's a guide to revamping your financial behaviors to achieve the life you want.

http://nitroflare.com/view/E9A42811E06A46D/1623170621.epub


Vandana Shiva, "Who Really Feeds the World?: The Failures of Agribusiness and the Promise of Agroecology" 
English | ISBN: 1623170621 | 2016 | 192 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Debunking the notion that our current food crisis must be addressed through industrial agriculture and genetic modification, author and activist Vandana Shiva argues that those forces are in fact the ones responsible for the hunger problem in the first place. Who Really Feeds the World? is a powerful manifesto calling for agricultural justice and genuine sustainability, drawing upon Shiva’s thirty years of research and accomplishments in the field. Instead of relying on genetic modification and large-scale monocropping to solve the world’s food crisis, she proposes that we look to agroecology—the knowledge of the interconnectedness that creates food—as a truly life-giving alternative to the industrial paradigm. Shiva succinctly and eloquently lays out the networks of people and processes that feed the world, exploring issues of diversity, the needs of small famers, the importance of seed saving, the movement toward localization, and the role of women in producing the world's food.

Ci prendono per fessi - L'economia della manipolazione e del'inganno - George A. Akerlof & Robert J. Shiller
Italian | 2016 | 335 Pages | ISBN: 8804663227 | EPUB | 681.2 KB

Fin dai tempi di Adam Smith, il pensiero economico ha tessuto le lodi del libero mercato che, quasi fosse governato da una mano invisibile, riuscirebbe a conciliare la ricerca dell'interesse personale con il benessere dell'intera società, trasformando il vantaggio individuale in bene comune. A questa concezione idilliaca lanciano una sfida radicale due premi Nobel dell'economia, George Akerlof e Robert Shiller, sostenendo che i mercati ci procurano tanti danni quanti benefici, e lungi dall'essere fondamentalmente benigni sono intrinsecamente disseminati di trappole e di esche cui finiamo per abboccare. Perché ogni volta che c'è un profitto da ricavare, i venditori non esiteranno a sfruttare le nostre debolezze psicologiche, la nostra superficialità e la nostra ignoranza per manipolarci e piazzarci la loro merce al prezzo più alto. È più che legittimo, quindi, applicare all'intero ambito dell'economia quella nozione di "phishing" nata fin dagli albori di Internet per definire il raggiro online, la "pesca degli ingenui" cui carpire informazioni, dati e, in definitiva, denaro. Ma mentre quella compiuta in Rete è un'azione illegale, un reato perseguito per legge, in economia è da sempre una pratica comune e indiscussa: raggirare ed essere raggirati è parte integrante dei rapporti fra gli attori del mercato. Per dimostrare la loro tesi, Akerlof e Shiller riportano una gran quantità di aneddoti ed episodi che rivelano come il phishing riguardi chiunque e ogni aspetto della nostra vita.

NGOs are as Canadian as hockey, declared a 1988 Parliamentary report. Few institutions epitomize the foundational Canadian myth of international benevolence like the non-governmental organization devoted to development abroad. This book raises important questions about these organizations and their development projects: Just how non-governmental are organizations that get most of their funding from government agencies? What impact do these funding ties have on NGOs' ability to support popular demands for democratic reforms and wealth redistribution? What happens when NGOs support a repressive regime? What happens when NGOs bite the hand that feeds them?

Gregory T. Haugan, "The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios" 
English | ISBN: 1466505184 | 2012 | 420 pages | PDF | 5 MB

The ongoing changes in population, climate, and the availability of energy have resulted in unprecedented threats and opportunities that all project and program managers, portfolio managers, and public planners need to be aware of. The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios offers a clear look at how these constraints will impact project undertakings and overlay the current classic constraints of cost, schedule, and performance. 

The book provides current facts and information on population, climate change, and energy issues—identifying trends and outlining opportunities in the form of a set of overlays (summary conclusions). The overlays are indexed to current changes that collectively represent a major turning point in the way we use resources and our growing need to seek sustainability. Identifying how changes in the new triple constraints will impact long-range planning, the book: 

Explains the rationale behind population forecasts and the likely impact on global supply and demand 
Highlights emerging trends in global temperatures and sea level rise, and the impacts on ecology, biology, and the marine environment without political spin
Includes SWOT analyses of fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and renewable fuels to assist in planning programs that depends upon these energy sources
Provides expert estimates and forecasts of energy availability and alternatives
Discusses the risks of various energy options
Contains supporting Appendices and a comprehensive Bibliography

Most program life cycles last five to ten years, and infrastructure programs last 40 to 50 years; the text provides a rational basis for approaching the new problems that all program and portfolio managers will soon have to deal with. It will help you identify and recognize these current and projected circumstances and risks so you will understand and be prepared to make the most of the major changes impacting the upcoming decision environment.

Mindset: The New Psychology of Success By Carol S. Dweck
2008 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0345472322 | EPUB + MOBI | 3 MB


Mindset is one of those rare books that can help you make positive changes in your life and at the same time see the world in a new way. A leading expert in motivation and personality psychology, Carol Dweck has discovered in more than twenty years of research that our mindset is not a minor personality quirk: it creates our whole mental world. It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets. If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone–either you have them or you don’t. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity–and success. Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting. She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields–music, literature, science, sports, business–apply the growth mindset to achieve results. Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment. She looks across a broad range of applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. Highly engaging and very practical, Mindset breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.

Common Stocks and Common Sense: The Strategies, Analyses, Decisions, and Emotions of a Particularly Successful Value Investor by Edgar Wachenheim III
2016 | ISBN: 1119259606 | English | 224 pages | EPUB | 0.4 MB

Deep insight and candid discussion from one of Wall Street's best investors
Common Stocks and Common Sense provides detailed insight into common stock investing, using a case-study approach based on real-world investments. Author Edgar Wachenheim is the 28-year CEO of Greenhaven Associates, boasting an average annual portfolio comparable to Warren Buffet's. In this book, he shares his knowledge and experiences by providing detailed analyses of actual investments made by himself and other investors. The discussion covers the entire investment process, including the softer, human side, with candid insight into the joys and frustrations, intensities and pressures, and risks and uncertainties. The unique emphasis on behavioral economics and real-world cases set this book apart from the herd—but it's Wachenheim himself and his deeply-examined perspective that elevates the book beyond a mere investing guide.

Between 1990 and 2014, a typical portfolio managed by Wachenheim enjoyed an average annual return in excess of 18%, achieved using relatively conservative stocks and no financial leverage. As a proponent of evidence and example, his analysis of real cases serve as a valuable education for anyone looking to improve their own investment practices.

Understand investment through the lens of a Wall Street leader
Dig into the details of real-world common stock investing
Learn how to invest creatively and minimize risk
Go beyond theory to study strategy on a case-by-case basis
Investment principles and strategies are easy to find—entire libraries have been written about theories and methods and what 'should' happen. But this book goes beyond the typical guide to show you how these ideas are applied in the real world—and what actually happened. Investors seeking real insight, real expertise, and a proven track record will find Common Stocks and Common Sense a uniquely useful resource.

Die Arbeit untersucht den Einfluss des psychologischen Persönlichkeitskonstrukts der Dunklen Triade, bestehend aus Narzissmus, Psychopathie und Machiavellismus, auf die Strategien der Emotionsarbeit sowie der daraus resultierenden positiven und negativen Konsequenzen für Angestellte im Dienstleistungssektor. Die Daten einer hierfür konzipierten Online-Befragung von 255 Dienstleistungsmitarbeitern zeigen, dass Psychopathen und Narzissten Oberflächenhandeln nutzen, um ihre Emotionen in der Interaktion mit Kunden zu regulieren. Letztere wenden auch die Strategie des Tiefenhandelns an. Zudem bestätigen die Befunde, dass Oberflächenhandeln den Einfluss der Dunklen Triade auf Erschöpfung vermittelt, wobei Tiefenhandeln als partieller Mediator in der Beziehung von Narzissmus und Engagement fungiert. Engagement erhöht in der Folge die Zufriedenheit und Leistung des Angestellten.

715 <--> The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism
http://nitroflare.com/view/B40549634EDB555/0262034573.pdf


The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism (MIT Press) by Arun Sundararajan
2016 | ISBN: 0262034573 | English | 256 pages | PDF | 6 MB

Sharing isn't new. Giving someone a ride, having a guest in your spare room, running errands for someone, participating in a supper club – these are not revolutionary concepts. What is new, in the "sharing economy," is that you are not helping a friend for free; you are providing these services to a stranger for money. In this book, Arun Sundararajan, an expert on the sharing economy, explains the transition to what he describes as "crowd-based capitalism" – a new way of organizing economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model. As peer-to-peer commercial exchange blurs the lines between the personal and the professional, how will the economy, government regulation, what it means to have a job, and our social fabric be affected?

Drawing on extensive research and numerous real-world examples – including Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Etsy, TaskRabbit, France's BlaBlaCar, China's Didi Kuaidi, and India's Ola, Sundararajan explains the basics of crowd-based capitalism. He describes the intriguing mix of "gift" and "market" in its transactions, demystifies emerging blockchain technologies, and clarifies the dizzying array of emerging on-demand platforms. He considers how this new paradigm changes economic growth and the future of work. Will we live in a world of empowered entrepreneurs who enjoy professional flexibility and independence? Or will we become disenfranchised digital laborers scurrying between platforms in search of the next wedge of piecework? Sundararajan highlights the important policy choices and suggests possible new directions for self-regulatory organizations, labor law, and funding our social safety net.

http://nitroflare.com/view/34490DD59DAAFAB/0199378320_From.pdf


From Big Data to Big Profits: Success with Data and Analytics By Russell Walker
2015 | 312 Pages | ISBN: 0199378320 | PDF | 3 MB


Vast holdings and assessment of consumer data by large companies are not new phenomena. Firms' ability to leverage the data to reach customers in targeted campaigns and gain market share is, and on an unprecedented scale. Major companies have moved from serving as data or inventory storehouses, suppliers, and exchange mechanisms to monetizing their data and expanding the products they offer. Such changes have implications for both firms and consumers in the coming years. In Success with Big Data, Russell Walker investigates the use of internal Big Data to stimulate innovations for operational effectiveness, and the ways in which external Big Data is developed for gauging, or even prompting, customer buying decisions. Walker examines the nature of Big Data, the novel measures they create for market activity, and the payoffs they can offer from the connectedness of the business and social world. With case studies from Apple, Netflix, Google, and Amazon, Walker both explores the market transformations that are changing perceptions of Big Data, and provides a framework for assessing and evaluating Big Data. Although the world appears to be moving toward a marketplace where consumers will be able to "pull" offers from firms, rather than simply receiving offers, Walker observes that such changes will require careful consideration of legal and unspoken business practices as they affect consumer privacy. Rigorous and meticulous, Success with Big Data is a valuable resource for graduate students and professionals with an interest in Big Data, digital platforms, and analytics.

Management Gurus and Management Fashions by Brad Jackson
English | Apr. 28, 2001 | ISBN: 0415249465, 0415249457 | 225 Pages | PDF | 1 MB

Since the 1980s, popular management thinkers, ‘gurus’, have promoted a number of performance improvement programs and management fashions which have greatly influenced both the everyday conduct of organizational life and the preoccupations of academic researchers. This book provides a rhetorical critique of the management guru and management fashion phenomenon, building on the important theoretical progress that has recently been made by a small, but growing band of management researchers.
Fantasy theme analysis, a dramatically-based method of rhetorical criticism, is conducted to critique three of the most important management fashions to have emerged during the 1990s:
* the re-engineering movement promoted by Michael Hammer and James Champy
* the effectiveness movement led by Stephen Covey
* the learning organization movement inspired by Peter Senge and his colleagues.
In addition to its rhetorical and empirical contributions, this book stimulates a much-needed critical dialogue between practitioners and academics on the sources of the underlying appeal of management gurus and management fashions, and their effect upon the quality of management and organizational learning.

http://nitroflare.com/view/85FBF740BB6AA47/0521715032%2C0521886988.pdf


Globalization and the Race to the Bottom in Developing Countries: Who Really Gets Hurt? by Nita Rudra
English | Oct. 13, 2008 | ISBN: 0521715032, 0521886988 | 316 Pages | PDF | 2 MB

The advance of economic globalization has led many academics, policy-makers, and activists to warn that it leads to a 'race to the bottom'. In a world increasingly free of restrictions on trade and capital flows, developing nations that cut public services are risking detrimental effects to the populace. Conventional wisdom suggests that it is the poorer members of these societies who stand to lose the most from these pressures on welfare protections, but this new study argues for a more complex conceptualization of the subject. Nita Rudra demonstrates how and why domestic institutions in developing nations have historically ignored the social needs of the poor; globalization neither takes away nor advances what never existed in the first place. It has been the lower- and upper-middle classes who have benefited the most from welfare systems and, consequently, it is they who are most vulnerable to globalization's race to the bottom.

English | 20 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 3658132868 | 304 Pages | PDF (True) | 4.13 MB

This book investigates the recent rise of the market-oriented value chain approach in development policy with a focus on the agro-export sector in the Global South. The research project aims at unveiling the political, social and cultural processes around the circulation of market rationales at the global scale and on the ground. In-depth analyses of two exemplary settings, Peru and Ghana, reveal the extent to which national policies, development programs, laws and academic curricula have adopted a "thinking in terms of value chains" in the last decade. By embracing the perspectives of policymakers, consultants, entrepreneurs and producers, this book provides exciting first-hand insights about the making of markets for scholars and development practitioners alike.

Unter Verwendung einer experimentellen Studie zeigt Markus Gahler, dass Konsumenten in internetbasierten PWYW-Situationen durchaus bereit sind positive Preise zu zahlen. Die Ergebnisse seiner regressionsbasierten Modellschätzung verdeutlichen, dass bei geltender Käuferanonymität die freiwillige Zahlungsbereitschaft durch einen vom Verkäufer kommunizierten externen Referenzpreis positiv beeinflusst wird. Dieser Effekt wird bei Gütern mit niedrigen variablen Kosten über das soziale Motiv der Fairness mediiert.

Unternehmensfitness: 'raus aus dem Mittelmaß!: Systematisches Training von Arbeits- und Verhaltensweisen für nachhaltigen Erfolg by Volkmar Völzke
German | 27 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658087498 | 179 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

Dieses neuartige Fitnessbuch für unternehmerische Leistungssteigerung gibt allen Managern und Geschäftsleitern konkrete und erprobte Trainingspläne an die Hand, die sie direkt in ihrem Unternehmen oder ihrer Abteilung umsetzen können – mit garantiert positivem Effekt auf die nachhaltige Leistungsfähigkeit der Mitarbeiter.

Denn nachhaltiger unternehmerischer Erfolg muss genauso wie im Spitzensport systematisch trainiert werden, und zwar in allen Dimensionen wie zum Beispiel Führung, Kundenfokus, Begeisterung der Mannschaft und operative Leistungsfähigkeit.

Die meisten Manager, Teams und Unternehmen bleiben aber weit unter Ihren Möglichkeiten, weil sie Erfolg zu sehr an äußere Umstände koppeln anstatt an die verborgenen Kräfte im eigenen Unternehmen. Genau wie die besten Mannschaften im Spitzensport sind auch die dauerhaft erfolgreichsten Unternehmen nicht durch „glückliche Umstände“ dauerhaft an der Spitze, sondern, weil sie alle entscheidenden Potenziale systematisch trainieren.

Redefining Well-Being in Nations and Organizations is an essential book for researchers, policy makers and managers. It provides a new multi-disciplinary perspective on wellbeing and engagement, reviewing the latest research from several previously unrelated disciplines to develop a process for active committed enthusiasm (PACE), encompassing theory and clarifying the definitions of, and relationships between, wellbeing, engagement and related concepts. PACE allows researchers to model causal relationships, and policy makers and managers to analyze the potential impact of possible interventions. It demonstrates that, as nations, organizations and individuals fulfil their basic material needs, the impact of individual optimism, and other aspects of positive psychology, become paramount in maximizing wellbeing and engagement.

Frackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment by Wenonah Hauter
2016 | ISBN: 1620970074 | English | 384 pages | PDF | 9 MB

Over the past decade a new and controversial energy extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has rocketed to the forefront of U.S. energy production. With fracking, millions of gallons of water, dangerous chemicals, and sand are injected under high pressure deep into the earth, fracturing hard rock to release oil and gas.

Wenonah Hauter, one of the nation’s leading public interest advocates, argues that the rush to fracking is dangerous to the environment and treacherous to human health. Frackopoly describes how the fracking industry began; the technologies that make it possible; and the destruction and poisoning of clean water sources and the release of harmful radiation from deep inside shale deposits, creating what the author calls sacrifice zones” across the American landscape.

The book also examines the powerful interests that have supported fracking, including leading environmental groups, and offers a thorough debunking of its supposed economic benefits. With a wealth of new data, Frackopoly is essential and riveting reading for anyone interested in protecting the environment and ensuring a healthy and sustainable future for all Americans.

Springer | Business & Management | July 8 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319389734 | 318 pages | pdf | 5.86 mb

Editors: D'Ascenzo, F., Magni, M., Lazazzara, A., Za, S. (Eds.)
Highlights a collection of multidisciplinary contributions in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation
Presents an overview of the research methods currently applied by the broader community of IS scholars
Outlines the most relevant research topics in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation

This book examines the impact of digital innovation on organizations. It reveals how the digital revolution is redefining traditional levels of analysis while at the same time blurring the internal and external boundaries of the organizational environment. It presents a collection of research papers that examine the interaction between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and behavior from a threefold perspective: First, they analyze individual behavior in terms of specific organizational practices like learning, collaboration and knowledge transfer, as well as the use of ICT within the organization. Second, they explore the dynamics at work on the border between the internal and the external environments by analyzing the organizational impact of ICT usage outside the company, as can be seen in employer branding, consumer behavior and organizational image. Third, they investigate how ICT is being adopted to help face societal challenges outside the company like waste and pollution, smart cities, and e-government. 
The diversity of views offered makes this book particularly relevant for users, companies, scientists and governments. The content is based on a selection of the best papers – original double-blind peer reviewed contributions –presented at the annual conference of the Italian chapter of AIS, which took place in Rome, Italy, in October 2015, or in other reputable international peer-refereed Information Systems conferences.

Greek Capitalism in Crisis: Marxist Analyses by Stavros Mavroudeas
English | 2014 | ISBN: 041574492X | 262 pages | PDF | 1,2 MB

Despite the depth of the Greek crisis, the exorbitant burdens placed upon the working people and the massive popular resistance movement to capitalist policies, there is a definite lack of consistently Marxist analyses of the Greek problem. International debates regarding the Greek crisis have been dominated by orthodox (Neoclassical and neo-Keynesian) approaches.

The heterodox side of these debates has been occupied by Radical Political Economy approaches (usually radical post-Keynesian or Marxo-Keynesian perspectives). Moreover, they are dominated by the ‘financialisation’ thesis which is quite alien to Marxism, neglects the sphere of production and professes that the global crisis is simply a financial crisis that has nothing to do with ‘real’ accumulation and the profit rate.

This book argues that by emphasising the sphere of production and profitability, classical Marxist analysis better explains the Greek crisis than its orthodox and heterodox competitors. The contributors present critiques of the prevalent approaches and offer studies of the Greek crisis that use the methodology and the analytical and empirical tools of classical Marxist Political Economy. In particular, it is shown that the Greek crisis was caused by falling profitability and the ensuing overaccumulation crisis. The ‘broad unequal exchange’ existing between the euro-center and the euro-periphery contributed to Greek capital’s falling profitability. This book enriches the debate about the Greek economic crisis by demonstrating the insights that can be drawn by considering the Marxist alternative to the dominant mainstream and heterodox approaches.

World Economic Forum's Financial Development Index
English | 2008 | ISBN: 9295044088 | 362 Pages | PDF | 17 MB

While financial systems are a key factor in economic growth, there is still surprisingly little agreement about how to define and measure their development. To address this gap, the World Economic Forum has undertaken a research initiative aimed at providing business leaders and policymakers with a common framework to identify and discuss the key factors in the development of global financial systems and markets.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction: The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism by Daniel E. Saros
English | 2014 | ISBN: 0415742927 | 292 pages | PDF | 1 MB

The failure of command central planning in the twentieth century has led to a general disillusionment within the socialist movement worldwide. Some alternatives to capitalism have been proposed since the end of the Cold War, but none has offered an alternative form of economic calculation. 

This book explains how modern information technology may be used to implement a new method of economic calculation that could bring an end to capitalism and make socialism possible.

In this book, the author critically examines a number of socialist proposals that have been put forward since the end of the Cold War. It is shown that although these proposals have many merits, their inability effectively to incorporate the benefits of information technology into their models has limited their ability to solve the problem of socialist construction. The final section of the book proposes an entirely new model of socialist development, based on a "needs profile" that makes it possible to convert the needs of large numbers of people into data that can be used as a guide for resource allocation. This analysis makes it possible to rethink and carefully specify the conditions necessary for the abolition of capital and consequently the requirements for socialist revolution and, ultimately, communist society.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction will be of interest to students and scholars of political economy, the history of economic thought, labour economics and industrial economics.

736 <--> Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics
http://nitroflare.com/view/F90EB0CEB4654F0/0873896483.pdf


James L Lamprecht, "Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics" 
2005 | ISBN-10: 0873896483 | 304 pages | PDF | 2 MB

With the rise of Six Sigma, the use of statistics to analyze and improve processes has once again regained a prominent place in businesses around the world. An increasing number of employees and managers, bestowed with the titles Green Belt, Black Belt, or even Master Black Belts, are asked to apply statistical techniques to analyze and resolve industrial and non-industrial (also known as transactional) problems. These individuals are continuously faced with the daunting task of sorting out the vast array of sophisticated techniques placed at their disposal by an equally impressive array of statistical computer software packages. 

This book is intended for the ever-growing number of certified Black Belts as well as uncertified others that would like to understand how data can be analyzed. Many courses, including Six Sigma Black Belt courses, do a good job introducing participants to a vast array of sophisticated statistical techniques in as little as ten days, leaning heavily on statistical software packages. Although it is true that one can simplify statistical principles, learning how to interpret results produced by any statistical software requires the understanding of statistics that this book concisely provides. 

Benefits: 

Numerous examples illustrate how various techniques are applied. 

Each example is reviewed from the perspective of what was not said in the example; in other words, the very information you will be faced with when you conduct your own analysis. 

Titles of some sections in the book include the word optional or advanced. These sections cover more advanced but nonetheless useful topics, but skipping these sections will not affect the overall flow of the various subjects presented.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks (Financial Markets and Investments) by H. Kent Baker and Greg Filbeck
English | 2015 | ISBN: 0199375879 | 624 pages | PDF | 5 MB

During the past few decades, private equity (PE) has attracted considerable attention from investors, practitioners, and academicians. In fact, a substantial literature on PE has emerged. PE offers benefits for institutional and private wealth management clients including diversification and enhancement of risk-adjusted returns. However, several factors such as liquidity concerns, regulatory restrictions, and the lack of transparency limit the attractiveness of some PE options to investors. The latest volume in the Financial Markets and Investments Series, Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks offers a synthesis of the theoretical and empirical literature on PE in both emerging and developed markets. Editors H. Kent Baker, Greg Filbeck, Halil Kiymaz and their co-authors examine PE and provide important insights about topics such as major types of PE (venture capital, leveraged buyouts, mezzanine capital, and distressed debt investments), how PE works, performance and measurement, uses and structure, and trends in the market. Readers can gain an in-depth understanding about PE from academics and practitioners from around the world.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks provides a fresh look at the intriguing yet complex subject of PE. A group of experts takes readers through the core topics and issues of PE, and also examines the latest trends and cutting-edge developments in the field. The coverage extends from discussing basic concepts and their application to increasingly complex and real-world situations. This new and intriguing examination of PE is essential reading for anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of PE, from seasoned professionals to those aspiring to enter the demanding world of finance.

Der Studienwahlprozess: Soziale und institutionelle Einflussfaktoren by Alexandra Kloß
German | 7 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 3658123656 | 392 Pages | PDF (True) | 10.77 MB

Alexandra Kloß zeigt auf, welche Faktoren die wegweisende Entscheidung der Studienwahl beeinflussen. Sie analysiert sowohl soziale Determinanten, wie die Anzahl der Geschwister, die Familienkonstellation und insbesondere die soziale Herkunft, als auch institutionelle Einflussfaktoren, wie Studienfinanzierungsmodelle, Studiengebühren oder auch Zulassungsbeschränkungen. Die unterschiedlichen Aspekte der Fragestellung werden anhand eigens erhobener Umfragedaten in Thüringen sowie der Datensätze des NEPS und des Studierendensurveys in 11 Wellen untersucht. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die Studienwahl viel weniger vom eigenen Willen geprägt ist, als man annehmen mag.

When the Money Runs Out: The End of Western Affluence by Stephen D. King
English | 2013 | ISBN: 0300190522, 0300205236 | 304 pages | EPUB | 0,4 MB

The Western world has experienced extraordinary economic progress throughout the last six decades, a prosperous period so extended that continuous economic growth has come to seem normal. But such an era of continuously rising living standards is a historical anomaly, economist Stephen D. King warns, and the current stagnation of Western economies threatens to reach crisis proportions in the not-so-distant future.

Praised for the “dose of realism” he provided in his book Losing Control, King follows up in this volume with a plain-spoken assessment of where the West stands today. It’s not just the end of an age of affluence, he shows. We have made promises to ourselves that are achievable only through ongoing economic expansion. The future benefits we expect—pensions, healthcare, and social security, for example—may be larger than tomorrow’s resources. And if we reach that point, which promises will be broken and who will lose out? The lessons of history offer compelling evidence that political and social upheaval are often born of economic stagnation. King addresses these lessons with a multifaceted plan that involves painful—but necessary—steps toward a stable and just economic future.

Consumer Energy Conservation Behavior After Fukushima: Evidence from Field Experiments (SpringerBriefs in Economics) by Isamu Matsukawa
English | 23 May 2016 | ISBN: 981101096X | 120 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.45 MB

This book presents an in-depth empirical analysis of consumer response to alternative policies for energy conservation. Its main focus is on innovative policy instruments that have attracted increasing attention from academics and energy conservation practitioners alike: critical peak pricing, conservation requests, in-home displays, and home energy reports. The book investigates the effects of these policy instruments on residential demand for electricity. The data is drawn from a series of randomized field experiments for the years 2012–2013 in Japan, where serious concerns about power shortages have emerged in the wake of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. By applying econometric techniques to the quantitative analysis of residential power consumption, the book demonstrates how consumers respond to innovative instruments for energy conservation. It also offers new perspectives on how these instruments can be used more effectively and explores the potential for their practical implementation. This highly informative book is essential reading for energy specialists in both academic and professional contexts.

Employer Branding für KMU: Die Bedeutung internationaler Kontakte bei der Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften (BestMasters) by David Vinzenz Hanußek
German | 24 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3658118342 | 184 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.32 MB

David Hanußek erforscht die Bedeutung von internationalen Kontakten und die Kreation einer Arbeitgebermarke für die Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften in kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU). Auf Grundlage von Umfragen bei Arbeitgebern in der Region Nordschwarzwald zeigt er, dass die Attraktivität eines Arbeitgebers vor allem von dessen Flexibilität in der Gestaltung des Arbeitsumfeldes und dessen Innovationsfähigkeit abhängt. Gerade KMU haben oft nicht die Mittel, sich mit einer Arbeitgebermarke auch international richtig zu positionieren. Im Wettbewerb um Arbeitskräfte ist daher die Region entscheidend: Politik, Tourismus- und Stadtmarketing, Industrie-, Handels- sowie Handwerkskammern sollten hier Hand in Hand arbeiten, um über die Region und die Gesamtheit der Unternehmen auch das einzelne Unternehmen attraktiv zu machen.

Personalgewinnung in Zeiten des Fachkräftemangels: Quereinsteiger als potenzielle Kandidaten entdecken by Sylvia Knecht
German | 3 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658131632 | 180 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.33 MB

Dieses Buch zeigt, dass Quereinsteiger für Unternehmen bisher wenig erkannte Leistungsbringer sein können. In Politik und im Ehrenamt sind sie bereits an der Tagesordnung. In der Wirtschaft fehlt es aber nach wie vor an Mut, Wissen und Können, Bewerber unabhängig von bisher erbrachten Leistungsnachweisen zu beurteilen.

Die Autorin zeigt auf, warum sich dies ändern muss, welche Chancen sich bieten, wenn grundlegend neue Denkmuster zugelassen werden und wie man Quereinsteiger in Bewerbungsverfahren aktiv anspricht.

Und umgekehrt müssen sich die Quereinsteiger auch auf die Belange der Unternehmen einlassen. Getreu dem Motto: Der Kunde kauft nur, was er braucht, muss alles optimal auf die Bedürfnisse der potenziellen ‚Kundschaft‘ ausgerichtet werden. Dazu finden sich praktische Tipps und Anregungen, die helfen, schneller ins Unternehmen einzusteigen. 

Rund 1,2 Millionen Menschen wagen jährlich in Deutschland den Sprung in die berufliche Neuorientierung. Diese Quereinsteiger überzeugen durch neue Denkansätze, Motivation und Eigeninitiative.

The Himalayan Border Region: Trade, Identity and Mobility in Kumaon, India (Advances in Asian Human-Environmental Research) by Christoph Bergmann
English | 5 May 2016 | ISBN: 3319297058 | 208 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.98 MB

Drawing from extensive archival work and long-term ethnographic research, this book focuses on the so-called Bhotiyas, former trans-Himalayan traders and a Scheduled Tribe of India who reside in several high valleys of the Kumaon Himalaya. The area is located in the border triangle between India, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR, People’s Republic of China), and Nepal, where contestations over political boundaries have created multiple challenges as well as opportunities for local mountain communities. Based on an analytical framework that is grounded in and contributes to recent advances in the field of border studies, the author explores how the Bhotiyas have used their agency to develop a flourishing trans-Himalayan trade under British colonial influence; to assert an identity and win legal recognition as a tribal community in the political setup of independent India; and to innovate their pastoral mobility in the context of ongoing state and market reforms. By examining the Bhotiyas’ trade, identity and mobility this book shows how and why the Himalayan border region has evolved as an agentive site of political action for a variety of different actors.
