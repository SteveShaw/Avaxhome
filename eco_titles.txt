Introduction of Biotechnology in India's Agriculture: Impact, Performance and Economics by Vasant P. Gandhi
English | 28 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 9811010900 | 272 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.18 MB

Biotechnology can bring major breakthroughs in agriculture. The book examines the experience of introduction of biotechnology in Indian agriculture, specifically, examining the performance of Bt cotton versus non-Bt cotton across India’s major cotton states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which together account for nearly 70 percent of the country’s cotton production. Major advances in biotechnology have made it possible to directly identify genes, determine their functions, and transfer them from one organism to another. The advances have spawned many technologies and Bt cotton is one important outcome. Bt cotton has become one of the most widely cultivated transgenic crops and is currently grown in 21 countries - 11 developing and 10 industrialized countries. The Government of India was relatively late in permitting biotechnology, only approving the cultivation of three transgenic Bt cotton hybrids from April 2002. Many concerns were raised about their performance there was strong opposition from some quarters. In India, Gujarat and Maharastra were the first states to adopt them, followed by Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. Based on a sample of 694 farming households, the book examines and analyzes the performance on the yields, pesticide costs, seed costs, overall production costs and profits. It also reports on the environmental impacts, satisfaction with the technology and ways of improving its performance.

2004 | ISBN: 0071441883 | English | 288 pages | PDF | 3.6 MB

How to capture customers by learning to think the way they do

In Think Like Your Customer, Stinnett explains why the key to landing corporate customers is to learn to think about the things executives and business owners think about and understand how they make complex buying decisions.

Drawing upon his years of experience as a Fortune 500 consultant, he offers sales and marketing professionals a powerful framework for understanding the inner workings of a business; knowing what motivates its executives and influences their buying decisions; identifying a company's organizational structure and decision-making psychology; and using that information to develop a winning strategy for influencing how and why the customer buys.

Preventing Corporate Fiascos: A Systemic Approach by Thang Nhut Nguyen
English | 22 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 1137489642 | 139 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.13 MB

The lasting effects of corporate fiascos on business and the economy have spurred investigations, panel discussions, and research in an attempt to find out why these events happen and ways to prevent them. Through case studies and analysis of bankruptcy and institutional collapse, Preventing Corporate Fiascos examines the root cause of these disasters and offers a management exceptions system that diagnoses potential failure from the start. 

Dr. Nguyen's unique framework is inspired by the biological spectrum, using cancer and disease as a metaphor for prevention and destruction. He uses a proven management repertory grid technique to evaluate aberrant and emotionally-charged decisions which could bring an institution to collapse. By recognizing the institution, its employees, the market and the economy as components of the biological spectrum, we can identify aggravating failure and disease and begin to take effective steps toward prevention.<

Transformationsmodell nachhaltiger Unternehmensführung durch Unternehmensentwicklung: Grundmodell betriebswirtschaftlicher Nachhaltigkeit by Martin Christian Kemnitz
German | 25 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 3658138661 | 232 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.83 MB

Dieses Buch befasst sich auf Basis wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse zur Unternehmensführung und Unternehmensentwicklung mit einem Grundmodell für die unternehmensindividuelle Entwicklung eines betriebswirtschaftlich nachhaltigen und wandlungsfähigen Managementsystems.

Das Buch hilft allen, die die notwendige Transformation Ihres Unternehmens von starren mechanistischen in beweglich lernfähige Einheiten bewältigen möchten. Die Idee des wandlungsfähigen Unternehmens kann dabei als Vorlage dienen. Nicht das modewellenförmig verlaufende Trendwissen, sondern Entwicklung, Aufbau, Implementierung und Anwendung einer nachhaltigen Managementinfrastruktur für Unternehmen führen heute zu langfristiger internationaler Wettbewerbsfähigkeit.

Nous aussi, la dette, on avait l'impression de ne rien y comprendre avant d'écrire ce livre. Il ne fallait pas compter sur les experts en expertise pour nous éclairer. Nous avions peur de ce qui allait nous tomber sur la tête. Jusqu'au jour où nous avons découvert ces vérités bouleversantes : Quel est le pays le plus endetté au monde ? Les Etats-Unis d'Amérique. Quelle est la seule superpuissance au monde ? Les Etats-Unis d'Amérique. Nous n'étions pas moins endettés, mais rassurés. Et nous avons mené notre enquête. Pour savoir combien on doit, à qui, pourquoi, depuis quand, jusqu'à quand ? Une certitude : si nous avons réussi à comprendre, vous comprendrez aussi !

2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658119373 | 484 pages | PDF | 4 MB

Kernziel der Arbeit ist das Aufzeigen von Schwierigkeiten und Verbesserungspotenzial in der Prävention von Occupational Fraud, was nicht nur in Kreditinstituten zu erheblichen finanziellen Verlusten führen kann und bereits geführt hat. Die Analyse hat gezeigt, dass – auch aufgrund der sehr komplexen Regulierung des Compliance- und Risikomanagements im Finanzsektor – die Umsetzung präventiver Maßnahmen eine große Herausforderung für Kreditinstitute darstellt. Dabei werden nicht nur Anforderungen der staatlichen Regulierung betrachtet, sondern auch branchenspezifische und branchenübergreifende Empfehlungen integriert. Abgerundet wird die theoretische Analyse durch eine empirische Untersuchung der bankwirtschaftlichen Praxis.

2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658119195 | 264 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Ina Weinbauer-Heidel untersucht, wie Unternehmen dem Transferproblem der betrieblichen Weiterbildung in der Praxis begegnen. Auf Basis der neo-institutionalistischen Organisationstheorie analysiert die Autorin erstmals wissenschaftlich, warum Unternehmen transferfördernde Maßnahmen (nicht) implementieren. Die empirischen Daten belegen, dass die in der Forschung identifizierten Maßnahmen in der Praxis nur selten zum Einsatz kommen. Es besteht ein Research-Practice Gap über dessen Ursachen bislang wenig bekannt ist. Ina Weinbauer-Heidel öffnet überraschende Einsichten in die verbreiteten Mythen über die Wirksamkeit betrieblicher Trainings und die Handlungslogiken, Motive und Ängste, die PersonalistInnen, TrainerInnen, Führungskräfte, TeilnehmerInnen und GeschäftsführerInnen bei der (Nicht-)Implementierung von Transfermaßnahmen leiten.

Christian Bosch untersucht in dieser Sonderform des Direktvertriebs auf der Grundlage von zwei quantitativen empirischen Studien sowohl das Konsumentenverhalten als auch das Abwanderungsverhalten von Vertriebspartnern. Dabei zeigt er in der ersten Studie, dass die Gestaltung von Verkaufsveranstaltungen für den Erfolg essentiell ist. Enge soziale Beziehungen zwischen den Akteuren und Teilnehmern führen zu einem aus Unternehmenssicht positiveren Konsumentenverhalten. In der zweiten Studie kann erstmals aufgezeigt werden, dass auch im Multi-Level-Marketing die in der einschlägigen Literatur etablierten Einflussfaktoren wie Vergütung und Anerkennung für erbrachte Leistungen die Abwanderungsabsicht von Vertriebspartnern mindern. Der soziale Nutzen einer Tätigkeit mindert ebenso die Absicht das Unternehmen zu verlassen.

Anhand einer quantitativen Befragung von ca. 1500 Jugendlichen und jungen Erwachsenen aus Baden-Württemberg weist Sarah Witzke eine zurückhaltende Tendenz hinsichtlich der Intention, zukünftig Carsharing-Fahrzeuge anstelle eines eigenen Autos nutzen zu wollen, nach. Sie zeigt, dass der Besitz eines eigenen Wagens für diese Gruppe demnach von großer Bedeutung ist. Durch eine lineare Regressionsrechnung konnten zudem zentrale Einflussfaktoren hinsichtlich der Carsharing-Intention identifiziert werden. Insbesondere der Einfluss bedeutsamer Dritter, die wahrgenommene Carsharingverfügbarkeit sowie das Bewusstsein um die umweltbelastende Wirkung des motorisierten Individualverkehrs sind demnach maßgebend.

Marina Melanie Strecker untersucht, wie organisationale Unterstützung für verschiedene Führungskräftetypen – im Topmanagement und im interkulturellen Umfeld – gestaltet werden muss, um die Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf zu fördern. Da die Vereinbarkeit dieser beiden Lebensbereiche wesentlichen Einfluss auf den Unternehmenserfolg nehmen kann, zeigt die Autorin, wie Unternehmen das individuelle Wohlbefinden und die Leistungsfähigkeit optimal fördern können. Die Analysen ihrer beiden empirischen Studien belegen, dass eine familienfreundliche Unternehmenskultur einen universalen Erfolgsfaktor darstellt, während strukturelle Maßnahmen zielgruppenspezifisch anzubieten sind.

Maxi Raida untersucht basierend auf Erkenntnissen der Stressliteratur und der Work-Family-Forschung, wie Führungskräfte durch die Gestaltung der Grenzen von Arbeit und Familie Konflikte zwischen den Lebensbereichen bewältigen können. Sie zeigt, dass der wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Wandel insbesondere Führungskräfte vor die Herausforderung stellt, die Anforderungen im Arbeits- und im Familienleben miteinander zu vereinbaren. Bisherige Ansätze für eine bessere Vereinbarkeit der beiden Lebensbereiche stützen sich auf organisationale Lösungen und vernachlässigen individuelle Handlungsmöglichkeiten. Mithilfe eines Multi-Source-Datensatzes zeigt die Autorin, dass die Vereinbarkeit von Arbeit und Familie durch räumliche und zeitliche Grenzen positiv beeinflusst werden kann und dadurch das Wohlbefinden und die Leistungsfähigkeit gefördert wird.

Am Beispiel der Bayerischen Repräsentanz in China ergründet Manuel Rimkus in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Funktionsweise staatlicher Wissensintermediation. Er zeigt, dass dabei genaue Kenntnisse der handlungsleitenden Motive eine zentrale Rolle spielen. Dementsprechend müssen sich die Instrumente der Außenwirtschaftsförderung den individuellen Erfahrungen und organisatorischen Kontexten anpassen, um Kooperationen zielgerichtet zu motivieren. Hier leisten Wissensintermediäre zur Lösung von Koordinations- und Motivationsproblemen in internationalen Beziehungen einen wichtigen Beitrag. Durch das Informations- und Kontaktmanagement auf Delegationsreisen, Messen und Veranstaltungen soll die grenzüberschreitende Zusammenarbeit gefördert werden.

Brent Lovelock and Kirsten Lovelock, "The Ethics of Tourism: Critical and Applied Perspectives" 
English | ISBN: 0415575583, 0415575575 | 2013 | 384 pages | PDF | 5 MB

There are increasingly strident calls from many sectors of society for the tourism industry, the world’s largest industry, to adopt a more ethical approach to the way it does business. In particular there has been an emphasis placed on the need for a more ethical approach to the way the tourism industry interacts with consumers, the environment, with indigenous peoples, those in poverty, and those in destinations suffering human rights abuses.

This book introduces students to the important topic of tourism ethics and illustrates how ethical principles and theory can be applied to address contemporary tourism industry issues. A critical role of the book is to highlight the ethical challenges in the tourism industry and to situate tourism ethics within wider contemporary discussions of ethics in general. Integrating theory and practice the book analyses a broad range of topical and relevant tourism ethical issues from the urgent ‘big-picture’ problems facing the industry as a whole (e.g. air travel and global warming) to more micro-scale everyday issues that may face individual tourism operators, or indeed, individual tourists. The book applies relevant ethical frameworks to each issue, addressing a range of ethical approaches to provide the reader with a firm grounding of applied ethics, from first principles. International case studies with reflective questions at the end are integrated throughout to provide readers with valuable insight into real world ethical dilemmas, encouraging critical analysis of tourism ethical issues as well as ethically determined decisions. Discussion questions and annotated further reading are included to aid further understanding.

The Ethics of Tourism: Critical and Applied Perspectives is essential reading for all Tourism students globally.

Эти важные мелочи. 163 способа добиться совершенства - Том Питерс
2012 | ISBN: 5961414825 | PDF | 608 pages | 7 Mb

Новая книга гуру менеджмента Тома Питерса обращает внимание читателя на мелочи — вещи, которые мы часто не замечаем, но которые в итоге оказываются решающими. Благодаря множеству приемов, в том числе графических, мы слышим живой голос автора, который размышляет, иронизирует, требует, просит понять: в жизни нет мелочей.
Если вы хотите достичь совершенства, важно абсолютно всё — ведь именно мелочи, детали, нюансы формируют отношения между людьми, направляют потребительский выбор и в итоге отделяют победителей от побежденных. Книга дает мощнейший импульс не только к анализу многих «важных мелочей», но и в первую очередь к действию. Книга ориентирована на широкую аудиторию.

25 <--> Money and Modernity: Pound, Williams, and the Spirit of Jefferson
http://avxhome.in/blogs/MoneyRich

Money and Modernity: Pound, Williams, and the Spirit of Jefferson by Alec Marsh
English | 30 Sept. 2011 | ISBN: 0817356959 | 264 Pages | PDF | 21 MB

Marsh locates Pound and Williams firmly in the Jeffersonian tradition and examines their epic poems as manifestations of a Jeffersonian ideology in modernist terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The modernist poets William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound were latter-day Jeffersonians whose politics and poetry were strongly marked by the populism of the late 19th century. They were sharply aware of the social contradictions of modernisation and were committed to a highly politicized, often polemical poetry that criticised finance capitalism and its institutions–notably banks–in the strongest terms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Providing a history of the aesthetics of Jeffersonianism and its collision with modernism in the works of Pound and Williams, Alec Marsh traces ""the money question"" from the republican period through the 1940s. Marsh can thus read two modernist epics–Pound's &lt;em&gt;Cantos&lt;/em&gt; and Williams's &lt;em&gt;Paterson&lt;/em&gt;–as the poets hoped they would be read, as attempts to break the hold of ""false"" financial values on the American imagination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Marsh argues that Pound's and Williams's similar Jeffersonian outlooks were the direct result of the political battles of the 1890s concerning the meaning of money. Although Pound's interest in money and economics is well known, few people are aware that both poets were active in the Social Credit monetary-reform movement of the 1930s and 1940s, a movement shown by Marsh to have direct links to Jeffersonianism via American populism. Ultimately, the two poets took divergent paths, with Pound swerving toward Italian fascism (as exemplified in his &lt;em&gt;Jefferson and/or Mussolini&lt;/em&gt;) and Williams becoming deeply influenced by the American pragmatism of John Dewey. Thus, Marsh concludes, Pound embraced the fascist version of state-capitalism whereas his old friend proclaimed a pragmatic openness to the new selves engendered by corporate capitalism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Money and Modernity &lt;/em&gt;exemplifies the best of recent literary criticism in its incorporation of American studies and cultural studies approaches to bring new insight to modern masterworks.

The Quest to Cyber Superiority: Cybersecurity Regulations, Frameworks, and Strategies of Major Economies
Springer | Economics | August 30, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319405535 | 240 pages | pdf | 3.02 mb

Authors: Kshetri, Nir
Emphasizes the international dimension of internet politics and cybersecurity
Presents qualitative and quantitative aspects related to the global cybersecurity
Cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary focus
Theory-based but practical and accessible to the wider audience

This book explains how major world economies are recognizing the need for a major push in cyber policy environments. It helps readers understand why these nations are committing substantial resources to cybersecurity, and to the development of standards, rules and guidelines in order to address cyber-threats and catch up with global trends and technological developments. A key focus is on specific countries’ engagement in cyberattacks and the development of cyber-warfare capabilities.
Further, the book demonstrates how a nation’s technological advancement may not necessarily lead to cyber-superiority. It covers cybersecurity issues with regard to conflicts that shape relationships between major economies, and explains how attempts to secure the cyber domain have been hampered by the lack of an international consensus on key issues and concepts. The book also reveals how some economies are now facing a tricky trade-off between economically productive uses of emerging technologies and an enhanced cybersecurity profile. In the context of current paradigms related to the linkages between security and trade/investment, it also delves into new perspectives that are being brought to light by emerging cybersecurity issues.

http://nitroflare.com/view/72D0035B449243E/10.1007%40978-94-017-7610-3.pdf


Special Types of Life Cycle Assessment
Springer | Sustainable Development | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 9401776083 | 399 pages | pdf | 7.59 mb

Editors: Finkbeiner, Matthias (Ed.)
For the first time, this book acknowledges spin-off methods and tools built on LCA, namely the “Special Types of Life Cycle Assessment”, and their importance for the growth of LCA
Part and consequence of the LCA success story is the increasing development of spin-off methods and tools built on LCA, namely the “Special Types of Life Cycle Assessment”
New approaches, or special types, built on the basis of classical LCA, generated a significant additional momentum to the growth of LCA

This book presents specialised methods and tools built on classical LCA. In the first book-length overview, their importance for the further growth and application of LCA is demonstrated for some of the most prominent species of this emerging trend: Carbon footprinting; Water footprinting; Eco-efficiency assessment; Resource efficiency assessment; Input-output and hybrid LCA; Material flow analysis; Organizational LCA.
Carbon footprinting was a huge driver for the market expansion of simplified LCA. The discussions led to an ample proliferation of different guidelines and standards including ISO/TS 14067 on Carbon Footprint of Product. Atsushi Inaba (Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan) and his eight co-authors provide an up-to-date status of Carbon Footprint of Products. The increasing relevance of Water Footprinting and the diverse methods were the drivers to develop the ISO 14046 as international water footprint standard. Markus Berger (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany), Stephan Pfister (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) and Masaharu Motoshita (Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan) present a status of water resources and demands from a global and regional perspective. A core part is the discussion and comparison of the different water footprint methods, databases and tools. Peter Saling from BASF SE in Ludwigshafen, Germany, broadens the perspective towards Eco-efficiency Assessment. He describes the BASF-specific type of eco-efficiency analysis plus adaptions like the so-called SEEBALANCE and AgBalance applications. Laura Schneider, Vanessa Bach and Matthias Finkbeiner (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany) address multi-dimensional LCA perspectives in the form of Resource Efficiency Assessment. Research needs and proposed methodological developments for abiotic resource efficiency assessment, and especially for the less developed area of biotic resources, are discussed.The fundamentals ofInput-output and Hybrid LCA are covered by Shinichiro Nakamura (Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan) and Keisuke Nansai (National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan). The concepts of environmentally extended IO, different types of hybrid IO-LCA and the waste model are introduced. David Laner and Helmut Rechberger (Vienna University of Technology, Austria) present the basic terms and procedures of Material Flow Analysismethodology. The combination of MFA and LCA is discussed as a promising approach for environmental decision support. Julia Martínez-Blanco (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany; now at Inèdit, Barcelona, Spain), Atsushi Inaba (Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan) and Matthias Finkbeiner (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany) introduce a recent development which could develop a new trend, namely the LCA of Organizations.

http://nitroflare.com/view/43FC4C668BC1125/3658054751.pdf


Gustav A. Horn, "Wirtschaftliche Krisen bewältigen: Neue Erkenntnisse aus den jüngsten Krisen" 
2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658054751 | 196 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Das Fachbuch gibt einen kompakten Überblick über den aktuellen Stand der Forschung zur Bekämpfung von wirtschaftlichen Krisen. Die Gedankenwelt der Ökonomen hat sich seit der Finanzmarktkrise und der Krise des Euroraums dramatisch verändert. In kurzer Zeit und unter hohem Druck mussten neue Instrumente der Krisenbekämpfung entwickelt und alte, als überkommen angesehene wieder angewandt werden. Der Autor zieht eine Zwischenbilanz dieser Reform ökonomischen Denkens. Dabei werden Forschungsergebnisse zu den genannten Begrifflichkeiten aufgearbeitet und im Hinblick auf ihre Tragfähigkeit zur Krisenerklärung diskutiert. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, wie wichtig die Geldpolitik ist, um Panik und Unsicherheit rasch bekämpfen zu können. Sie kommt aber schnell an ihre Grenzen, wenn sie nicht von einer aktiven Fiskalpolitik und einer Arbeitsmarktpolitik flankiert wird, die starke Impulse für Wachstum und Beschäftigung geben. Es bedarf somit einer aktiven gesamtwirtschaftlich orientierten Politik, um Krisen Herr zu werden.

Lars Binckebanck, Rainer Elste, "Digitalisierung im Vertrieb: Strategien zum Einsatz neuer Technologien in Vertriebsorganisationen" 
2015 | German | ISBN-10: 3658050535 | 663 pages | PDF | 19 MB

Dieses Werk beschäftigt sich aus verschiedenen Perspektiven mit dem innovativen und prozessorientierten Einsatz von neuen Technologien im Rahmen vertriebsstrategischer Grundsatzentscheidungen, konzeptioneller Rahmenbedingungen sowie leitender und operativer Verkaufsaktivitäten mit dem Ziel, Vertriebsergebnisse nachhaltig zu steigern und den Vertrieb als Wettbewerbsvorteil zu positionieren. Renommierte Autoren bereiten wissenschaftlich fundierte und aktuelle Erkenntnisse zur Digitalisierung im Vertrieb auf und geben anhand ausgewählter Praxisbeispiele Handlungsempfehlungen für die erfolgreiche Potenzialausschöpfung – auch über den Tellerrand der Vertriebsorganisation hinaus. Das Buch folgt dabei nicht dem üblichen Medienfokus, der auf Social Media & Co. gerichtet ist, sondern untersucht systematisch die Möglichkeiten und Erfolgsfaktoren, aber auch die Risiken diverser neuer Technologien für die Vertriebsarbeit.


„Die Frage ist, ob wir überhaupt noch einen Vertrieb benötigen, wenn das Web und andere Technologien auch den Verkauf übernehmen können. Das vorliegende Werk bejaht die Notwendigkeit des Vertriebs ausdrücklich. Um die vertrieblichen Potenziale neuer Technologien im Vertrieb effektiv und effizient nutzen zu können, müssen Unternehmen Ansätze entwickeln, die auf vertrieblichen Kernkompetenzen und -prozessen basieren. Nicht die Technologien selbst führen zum Erfolg, sondern die konsequente Anwendung im Rahmen einer übergeordneten Vertriebsstrategie.“ (aus dem Geleitwort von Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Hermann Simon)

2015 | German | ISBN-10: 3658041943 | 217 pages | PDF | 4 MB

​ Die Finanzkrise hinterlässt eine völlig veränderte Bankenlandschaft. In kürzester Zeit zerfielen nicht nur einstige Großbanken, sondern es formierten sich auch völlig veränderte Institute aus Fusionen und Übernahmen. Der verschärfte Wettbewerb unter Banken wird nicht nur unter dem Joch einer ungelösten Staatsschuldenkrise ausgetragen, sondern auch unter erhöhtem Druck der Bankenaufsicht und der nächsten Generation von Finanzdienstleistern. Viele Geschäftsmodelle wurden erst durch neue Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien möglich und harren auf Bewährung in der Praxis. Die Gesetzgebung erfasst inzwischen jedes Finanzinstitut und unterstellt es der Aufsicht. Das Buch zeigt nicht nur Konsequenzen der Regulierung und des Wettbewerbs für das Credit Rating von Banken, sondern auch Maßstäbe, Kriterien und Verfahren zur Beurteilung des existentiellen Risikos sonstiger Finanzinstitute auf.

Eva-Maria Walker, "Die Moralisierung der Finanzmärkte als Fiktion: Fallstudie zum Selbstverständnis nachhaltiger Investoren" 
2015 | German | ISBN-10: 3658055014 | 200 pages | PDF | 2 MB

​Die Frage nach einer „Moralisierung“ der Märkte greift in der wissenschaftlichen, aber auch öffentlichen Diskussion derzeit breit um sich. Beschränkte sich die Diskussion lange Zeit auf die Bereiche des Konsums, ist neuerdings sogar die Rede von einer „Moralisierung“ der Finanzmärkte. Nur: Haben wir es hier tatsächlich mit einer „Moralisierung“ der Märkte zu tun oder nicht eher mit einem analytisch unscharfen Verständnis von „Ökonomie“ und „Moral“? Die Arbeit greift diese Frage auf und entwickelt zunächst ein sozialkonstruktivistisch informiertes Verständnis von „moralischem“ Handeln. Mit Hilfe einer empirischen Fallstudie zum Selbstverständnis „nachhaltiger“ Aktieninvestoren prüft und analysiert sie sodann die Anlagepraxis jener Finanzinvestoren, die gemäß ihres kommunizierten Selbstverständnisses nicht nur ihren Renditezielen Rechnung tragen, sondern ebenfalls ihrer gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung als Aktionäre.

Michael Wagenknecht, "Der Einfluss der Besteuerung auf Finanzierungsentscheidungen: Eine methodologische Untersuchung" 
2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658127643 | 411 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Die vorliegende Untersuchung thematisiert die an eine Analyse von Steuerwirkungen im Kontext von Finanzierungsentscheidungen zu stellenden Anforderungen. Der Autor zeigt, dass die theoretische Erklärung des Einflusses der Besteuerung auf das Handeln von Individuen auf Basis neoklassischer Steuerwirkungshypothesen einem kritisch-rationalen Erklärungsverständnis nicht genügt, jedoch mit einem methodologisch instrumentalistischen Verständnis vereinbar ist. Die Methoden der empirischen Prüfung gehen grundsätzlich mit beiden Positionen einher, sofern gewisse Modifikationen der gängigen Forschungspraxis vorgenommen werden.

Die Arbeit liefert einen weiten Überblick über die modelltheoretischen Analysemöglichkeiten von Finanzmärkten. Christian Peitz hat neben der Anwendung herkömmlicher Methoden neue Modelle entworfen, wodurch große Teile der Arbeit sehr anwendungsorientiert sind. In den einzelnen empirischen Teilen wurden die Handelsdaten von Unternehmen, Indizes und Volatilitätsindizes benutzt. Auf Basis dieser Daten (ultra-hochfrequente, hochfrequente und niederfrequente) wurden praktisch relevante und leicht anzuwendende Volatilitätsmodelle entworfen, die für bestimmte Fragestellungen geeigneter sind als bisherige Modelle, in jedem Fall jedoch eine Alternative für die bisherigen Modelle darstellen (dazu zählen z.B. die semiparametrischen Erweiterungen des APARCH, EGARCH und CGARCH Modells).

Björn Kirsten, "Zum bilanzpolitischen Potential von Zinsinstrumenten in der IFRS-Bankbilanz" 
2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658116749 | 336 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Björn Kirsten deckt bilanzpolitische Spielräume auf, die u. a. entstehen, weil das ohnehin äußerst komplexe IFRS-Regelwerk besonders im Bereich der Bilanzierung finanzieller Vermögens- und Schuldpositionen sehr unübersichtlich ist. Der Autor stellt fest, dass die wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Publikationen diese Problematik in Bezug auf Zinsinstrumente bislang stiefmütterlich behandeln – mitunter negieren sie diese sogar explizit, obwohl die Spielräume, auch wenn sie nicht ausgenutzt werden, dem internationalen Rechnungslegungszweck entgegenstehen. Vor diesem Hintergrund analysiert Kirsten die bilanzpolitischen Potentiale im IFRS-Abschluss von Banken und erstellt Lösungsvorschläge, um die sich ergebenden negativen Auswirkungen einzudämmen. Dabei unterscheidet er zwischen Gestaltungen einerseits der Rechnungslegungsvorschriften und andererseits der Abschlussprüfung.

Allows readers to understand both theory and practice of asset management
Offers deep insights into investment policies
Includes a detailed analysis of the Black and Litterman asset allocation model

This book analyses investment management policies for institutional investors. It is composed of four parts.

This part goes on with an in-depth analysis of the economic, technical and regulatory characteristics of the different types of investment funds and of other types of asset management products, which have a high rate of substitutability with investment funds and represent their natural competitors. The second part of the book identifies and investigates the stages of the investment portfolio management. Given the importance of strategic asset allocation in explaining the ex post performance of any type of investment portfolio, this part provides an in-depth analysis of asset allocation methods, illustrating the different theoretical and operational solutions available to institutional investors. The third part describes performance assessment, its breakdown and risk control, with an in-depth examination of performance evaluation techniques, returns-based style analysis approaches, and performance attribution models. Finally, the fourth part deals with the subject of diversification into alternative asset classes, identifying the common characteristics and their possible role within the framework of investment management policies. This part analyses hedge funds, private equity, real estate, commodities, and currency overlay techniques.

Joe Girard, "How to Sell Anything to Anybody" 
2006 | ISBN-10: 0743273966 | 192 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

Joe Girard was an example of a young man with perseverance and determination. Joe began his working career as a shoeshine boy. He moved on to be a newsboy for the Detroit Free Press at nine years old, then a dishwasher, a delivery boy, stove assembler, and home building contractor. He was thrown out of high school, fired from more than forty jobs, and lasted only ninety-seven days in the U.S. Army. Some said that Joe was doomed for failure. He proved them wrong. When Joe started his job as a salesman with a Chevrolet agency in Eastpointe, Michigan, he finally found his niche. Before leaving Chevrolet, Joe sold enough cars to put him in the Guinness Book of World Records as 'the world's greatest salesman' for twelve consecutive years. Here, he shares his winning techniques in this step-by-step book, including how to: o Read a customer like a book and keep that customer for life o Convince people reluctant to buy by selling them the right way o Develop priceless information from a two-minute phone call o Make word-of-mouth your most successful tool Informative, entertaining, and inspiring, HOW TO SELL ANYTHING TO ANYBODY is a timeless classic and an indispensable tool for anyone new to the sales market.

Internationale Koordinierung Nationaler Enforcement-Aktivitäten von Roland Bockmann
Deutsch | 18. Juli 2012 | ISBN: 3834942278 | 422 Seiten | PDF | 2 MB

Diverse praktische Beobachtungen aus dem Blickwinkel der Deutschen Prüfstelle für Rechnungslegung (DPR), die als nationaler privatrechtlicher Enforcer innerhalb einer zweistufigen Private Public Partnership zusammen mit der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) für das Enforcement in Deutschland verantwortlich ist, münden in der Erkenntnis, dass die internationale Koordinierung nationaler Enforcement-Aktivitäten im jetzigen Zustand aktive Regulierungsarbitrage zulässt, regulatorische Kooperation zwischen nationalen Enforcern erschwert und die Entwicklung lokaler IFRS nicht verhindert. Vor diesem Hintergrund entwickelt Roland Bockmann idealtypische Konzeptionsmodelle, die ebendiese Unzulänglichkeiten adressieren und im besten Fall beseitigen können.

Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior in Japan: The Consequences of Stock Options and Corporate Diversification
Springer | Business & Management | August 29, 2016 | ISBN-10: 4431560041 | 88 pages | pdf | 1.57 mb

Authors: Hanazaki, Masaharu
Examines the traditional characteristics of corporate governance structure in Japan, and clarifies its recent institutional changes
Analyzes the effects of the introduction of stock options on corporate behavior and performance
Examines the validity of the theory that corporate diversification reduces corporate value in Japan

This book carefully examines the effects of changes in the corporate governance structure on corporate behavior or company performance, using micro-data from listed companies in Japan. The author found that in Japan the introduction of stock options had neither a positive impact on profitability nor the negative side effects of promoting risk-taking behaviors. Furthermore, he found that corporate diversification and division of corporations showed negative impacts on profitability.
The corporate governance structure of Japan has exhibited a large change from the second half of the 1990s to the present. There have been institutional reforms involving enterprise law, such as the introduction of stock options and the removal of the ban on holding companies. With respect to the ownership structure of a company, discernible trends are that the equity holdings of financial institutions and business corporations have fallen while the presence of foreign stockholders has risen. These trends are often pointed out as signs that the Japanese corporate governance structure has been approaching the American model and that this will energize Japanese firms.
The author contradicts common academic theories, however, and concludes that the formation of the corporate governance which emphasizes the agency problem between shareholders and corporate managers is inadequate. He suggests that an institutional arrangement for a corporate governance system that values a variety of stakeholders' interests is greatly needed and concludes that perspectives on maximizing surplus values for various stakeholders and distributing the surpluses appropriately among the stakeholders will become increasingly important for the purpose of managing corporations.

The Incomplete Currency: The Future of the Euro and Solutions for the Eurozone
Wiley | Accounting & Finance | June 27 2016 | ISBN-10: 1119019095 | 552 pages | pdf | 23.09 mb

by Marcello Minenna (Author), Giovanna Maria Boi (Author), Paolo Verzella (Author)

A fact-based treatise on the Eurozone crisis, with analysis of possible solutions
The Incomplete Currency is the only technical — yet accessible — analysis of the current Eurozone crisis from a global perspective. The discussion begins by explaining how the Euro's architecture, the relationship between finance and the real economy, and the functioning of the Eurosystem in general are all at the root of the current crisis, and then explores possible solutions rooted in fact, not theory. All topics are analysed and illustrated, making extensive use of examples, tables, and graphics, and the ideas presented are supported by data sets and their statistical elaborations throughout the book. An extensive digital component includes numerical simulations of public debt dynamics for different Eurozone countries, evaluations of the sustainability of programmes like the Fiscal Compact, and stress tests on the ability of institutions like the ESM to cope with major liquidity crises, and the spreadsheets used to calculate data in the book is provided for readers to access for themselves.

The survival of the European monetary union has been questioned due to the accumulation of structural imbalances and the negative effects of the global financial crisis. This book lays out the full extent of the problem, explains what caused it, and provides possible solutions backed by extensive data.

Dig down to the root of the Eurozone crisis
Learn why austerity doesn't fix anything
Understand how the Euro has changed economies
Consider possible strategies for recovery
In a macroeconomic context where the monetary policy is the prerogative of the European Central Bank and fiscal policy, hopeless austerity works against the economic recovery of the Eurozone countries. A positive attitude is difficult, but necessary. The Incomplete Currency is an insightful, important resource that guides readers toward real solutions.

Mindset: The New Psychology of Success By Carol S. Dweck
2008 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0345472322 | EPUB + MOBI | 3 MB


Mindset is one of those rare books that can help you make positive changes in your life and at the same time see the world in a new way. A leading expert in motivation and personality psychology, Carol Dweck has discovered in more than twenty years of research that our mindset is not a minor personality quirk: it creates our whole mental world. It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets. If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone–either you have them or you don’t. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity–and success. Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting. She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields–music, literature, science, sports, business–apply the growth mindset to achieve results. Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment. She looks across a broad range of applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. Highly engaging and very practical, Mindset breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.

Shadow Banking in China: An Opportunity for Financial Reform
Wiley | Banks & Banking | July 12 2016 | ISBN-10: 1119266327 | 288 pages | pdf | 6.33 mb

by Andrew Sheng (Author), Ng Chow Soon (Author)

An authoritative guide to the rise of Chinese shadow banking and its systemic implications
Shadow Banking in China examines this rapidly growing sector in the Chinese economy, and what it means for your investments. Written by two world-class experts in Chinese banking, including the Chief Advisor to the China Banking Regulatory Commission and former Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, this book is unique in providing true, first-hand perspectives from authorities within the world's largest economy. There is little widely-available information on China's shadow banking developments, and much of it is rife with disparate data, inaccuracies and overblown risks due to definitional and measurement differences. This book clears the confusion by supplying accurate information, on-the-ground context and invaluable national balance sheet analysis you won't find anywhere else.

Shadow banking has grown to be a key source of credit in China, and a major component of the economy. This book serves as a primer for analysts and investors seeking real, useful information about the sector to better inform investment decisions.

Discover what's driving the growth of shadow banking in China
Learn the truth about both real and inflated risks
Dig into popular rhetoric and clarify common misconceptions
Access valuable data previously not published in English
Despite shadow banking's critical influence on the Chinese economy, there have been very few official studies and even fewer books written on the subject. Understanding China's present-day economy and forecasting its future requires an in-depth understanding of shadow banking and its inter-relationship with the banking system and other sectors. Shadow Banking in China provides authoritative reference that will prove valuable to anyone with financial interests in China.

"The Chinese economy has experienced explosive growth in debt since 2009: total gross debt reached 282% of GDP in 2014, comparable to the developed economies. Particularly striking was the increase in non-financial sector corporate credit. Non-bank lending played a significant role in that build-up. In this important volume, the authors bring this complex and opaque system into the light and put it under a magnifying glass. They identify the opportunities for expanded equity and debt funding of businesses that will drive growth in the rapidly evolving Chinese economic structure. But they also highlight the risks of improperly priced risk, poor credit cultures, implicit guarantees relying on the state balance sheet, and lax regulation. It is essential reading for those seeking to understand the evolving structure of the financial system in China and the key reforms that are urgently required at this stage."
—A. Michael Spence, Nobel laureate; Professor of economics, New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business

"How serious is China's shadow banking issue? What Chinese characteristics does it have? Will it trigger the next financial crisis in China or globally? What policy measures should be adopted to address the risks in the shadow banking system? These are among a few of the most important questions examined in this book entitled Shadow Banking in China: An Opportunity for Financial Reform, edited by Andrew Sheng and Ng Chow Soon. This important book not only puts recent developments in China's shadow banking sector into proper perspective and context and identifies key Chinese characteristics underpinning the rapid growth of Chinese shadow banks, but also offers fresh insights on the interconnectivities and vulnerabilities at the sectoral level. It also provides useful policy recommendations at the macro and structural levels. The analyses are solid and comprehensive, and the conclusions are insightful and useful. I strongly recommend this top quality book to any reader interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the key risks rooted in China's shadow banking and how to sort them out, from the academic, policy and investment perspectives."
—Haizhou Huang, Managing Director, China International Capital Corporation

"Andrew Sheng, an experienced regulator with a complex systems view of finance, leads a team that investigates and sheds light for both Western and Eastern thinkers on the shadows (banks) of the Chinese financial markets. Read, learn, and marvel at how Sheng's creative mind, rigorous observation, and deep insights rise to the challenge to diagnose the fault lines of financial instability and to prescribe remedies to manage the dangers of these mysterious financial innovations in China."
—Robert Johnson, President, Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Senior Fellow and Director, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute

"Rapid financial and technological innovation is entangling regulators everywhere in an ongoing game of 'whack-a-mole' as they struggle to keep pace with burgeoning developments in shadow banking. Nowhere is this more true than in China, and nowhere are the information flows more opaque. Sheng and Ng's study is a must for those trying to seek truth from facts."
—Simon Ogus, Founder and CEO, DSG Asia Limited

The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers
Wiley | Business & Finance | June 27 2016 | ISBN-10: 1119191092 | 288 pages | pdf | 5.27 mb

by Baruch Lev (Author), Feng Gu (Author)

An innovative new valuation framework with truly useful economic indicators
The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers shows how the ubiquitous financial reports have become useless in capital market decisions and lays out an actionable alternative. Based on a comprehensive, large-sample empirical analysis, this book reports financial documents' continuous deterioration in relevance to investors' decisions. An enlightening discussion details the reasons why accounting is losing relevance in today's market, backed by numerous examples with real-world impact. Beyond simply identifying the problem, this report offers a solution—the Value Creation Report—and demonstrates its utility in key industries. New indicators focus on strategy and execution to identify and evaluate a company's true value-creating resources for a more up-to-date approach to critical investment decision-making.

While entire industries have come to rely on financial reports for vital information, these documents are flawed and insufficient when it comes to the way investors and lenders work in the current economic climate. This book demonstrates an alternative, giving you a new framework for more informed decision making.

Trendology: Building an Advantage Through Data-Driven Real-Time Marketing By C. Kerns
2014 | 252 Pages | ISBN: 1137479558 | PDF | 4 MB


Should an airline be talking about the royal baby? What's a candy bar doing Tweeting about a soccer match? Since when does laundry detergent weigh in on TV shows? Those conversations seem crazy, right? They're mismatched, they're nonsense… and they are working. In today's ongoing battle for consumer attention, brands have been using a new strategy called real-time marketing to engage their audience on topics that are already top of mind. In Trendology, Chris Kerns uses a data-driven approach to analyze how brands are using social media to finally answer the burning question: How should brands best capitalize on trends? Kerns dives into the data from more than 100 of the top brands on Twitter (including Disney, MTV, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, BMW, J.C. Penney, Nike, Sony, IKEA, and many more) to uncover patterns of real-time marketing performance across huge global events, smaller pop culture moments, breaking news stories, and daily hashtag trends. Along with these insights, readers will also learn: - What works for brands doing real-time marketing, and what should be avoided? - How to measure the performance of your real-time social strategy - How a brand can leverage trends on an every-day basis - Best practices to build a data-driven approach and team - The future of brands and social trends, including interviews with digital thought leaders from Arby's, the Boston Celtics, the Wharton School, the PGA Tour, and many more Trendology brings insight to a topic that has, for too long, been fueled by opinion and luck. This book not only shows that real-time marketing is here to stay, but gives brands the tools and guidance to build out a smart, data-driven approach to the newest marketing trend.

by Didier Cossin (Author), Ong Boon Hwee (Author)

The notion of stewardship has never been more relevant to business than it is today. It used to be enough for a business to create value for its owners and shareholders. However, with globalization has come the expectation for truly successful companies to also create lasting benefits to their markets, society and environment. Inspiring Stewardship lets you follow in the footsteps of some of the most accomplished stewards of our time.

This one-of-a-kind resource from two recognized thought leaders on corporate governance profiles a diverse range of steward leaders – from Ratan Tata to Warren Buffett – and examines innovative, quantitative research to present a complete guide to understanding the benefits of stewardship and factoring it into your everyday decision-making. It's not easy to balance short-term objectives and long-term goals with the needs of executives, owners and investors, unless you have a go-to well of dependable, supported wisdom and inspiring, real-world stories of how other leaders did it with extraordinary results. See where they get their exceptional drive and resilience, why they shoulder such huge responsibility and then decide for yourself if they are fundamentally different from you. Use the self-assessment to highlight your own path to becoming an exceptional steward leader, which includes:

A detailed examination of the key principles underpinning a well-stewarded organization
The core values safeguarded, promoted and actively acted on by steward leaders
The specific risks stewards open themselves up to and how to proactively manage those risks

Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Established Trading Tactics for Ultimate Profit
Wiley | Online Trading | July 5 2016 | ISBN-10: 1119048338 | 384 pages | pdf | 13.2 mb

by Ed Ponsi (Author)

Ed Ponsi's straightforward guide to understanding technical analysis
Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations delivers simple explanations and easy-to-understand techniques that demystify the technical analysis process. In his usual straightforward style, bestselling author Ed Ponsi guides you through the twists and turns to show you what really matters when it comes to making money. Whether you trade stocks, currencies, or commodities, you'll develop invaluable skills as you master difficult concepts and the tools of the trade. Technical analysis translates to any form of trading, and this book delivers clear, jargon-free guidance toward interpreting the various charts you'll see in the field.

Technical analysis can be confusing. Volatility, cycles, Elliot waves, Fibonacci, trends—it's easy to get lost, and most of the available literature is incomprehensible to all but the experts. This book is different—it's technical analysis for the rest of us. You'll see through the language to understand the underlying concepts, and how to apply them correctly.

Learn what true technical analysis entails
Discover the tools that simplify accurate analysis
Master the tactics and strategies used by the pros
Develop a valuable trading skill that transcends markets
Simply recognizing the vocabulary isn't nearly enough, and a passing acquaintance with the topic is guaranteed to do more harm than good. When technical analysis methods are used incorrectly, they are ineffective at best, and actively destructive to your bottom line at worst. Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations cuts through the confusion to give you a firm understanding and the skills to apply it correctly.

Praise for TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND CHART INTERPRETATIONS

"In Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations, Ed Ponsi does a tremendous job of breaking down the complex topic of technical analysis so that anyone can understand it, which is why I use his stuff regularly on Mad Money's Off the Charts segment. Ed's experience and unique insight allow him to do this without glossing over important nuances. The result is a detailed yet easily understood work that belongs in every investor's library."
—JIM CRAMER, CNBC Anchor, Host of Mad Money on CNBC

"Once again, Ed Ponsi displays his extraordinary depth of knowledge and consummate ability to convey some of the most useful strategies for taking on the financial markets—and winning. Very few financial experts have as extensive an understanding of market dynamics and effective trading strategies as Ed Ponsi. This shows through clearly in his new book, Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations. Much like Ponsi's previous works, this book is guaranteed to become a go-to standard for both new traders and seasoned professionals alike. If you want or need to understand the most practical technical analysis tools and techniques that can be applied successfully in the financial markets, Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations is an exceptionally outstanding choice."
—JAMES CHEN, CMT, author of Essentials of Technical Analysis for Financial Markets and Essentials of Foreign Exchange Trading; Chartered Market Technician and Chief Technical Strategist, City Index / Gain Capital

"In his latest book, Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations, Ed Ponsi has nailed the art of creating a 'one-stop-shop' for all things technical analysis. I was blown away by the sheer volume of analytical techniques, concepts, and candid opinions offered in this all-inclusive and easy-to-read book. I strongly believe Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations delivers invaluable lessons for traders of all skill levels and sizes. Whether you are a beginner or a pro, this book should be on your shelf!"
—CARLEY GARNER, Commodity Broker/Analyst, DeCarleyTrading

"Technical Analysis and Chart Interpretations is the full package for any trader or investor. Ed's view of technical analysis is brilliant and easy to follow. There are so few offerings of a 'soup to nuts' education on charting but this book is a must in every trader's book collection. It is rare to find a book on technicals that methodically takes you through the steps of successful interpretation. After reading Ed's book you will certainly find yourself on your way to becoming a successful chart reader."
—BOB LANG, Chief Strategist, explosiveoptions.net

"A must read for investors! Ed Ponsi convinced many CNBC viewers that profits are found in the trends, not the fundamentals. This book will convert many more."
—LISA OAKE, Founder and CEO, Oake Media; Former CNBC Asia Anchor

"Ed Ponsi walks you through the key concepts of technical analysis, giving you what you need to know in an easy-to-follow format. If you want to learn to trade with technical analysis, this is the book for you."
—DAVID STENDAHL, President, Signal Trading Group

Land Use Competition: Ecological, Economic and Social Perspectives
Springer | Sustainable Development | August 30, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319336266 | 369 pages | pdf | 6.63 mb

Editors: Niewöhner, J., Bruns, A., Hostert, P., Krüger, T., Nielsen, J.Ø., Haberl, H., Lauk, C., Lutz, J., Müller, D. (Eds.)
Provides new conceptual frames for analyzing land use competition
Offers a diverse range of case studies, reflecting the global context of research
Bridges various disciplines to encourage and enable interdisciplinary collaboration

This book contributes to broadening the interdisciplinary knowledge basis for the description, analysis and assessment of land use practices. It presents conceptual advances grounded in empirical case studies on four main themes: distal drivers, competing demands on different scales, changing food regimes and land-water competition. 
Competition over land ownership and use is one of the key contexts in which the effects of global change on social-ecological systems unfold. As such, understanding these rapidly changing dynamics is one of the most pressing challenges of global change research in the 21st century. This book contributes to a deeper understanding of the manifold interactions between land systems, the economics of resource production, distribution and use, as well as the logics of local livelihoods and cultural contexts. It addresses a broad readership in the geosciences, land and environmental sciences, offering them an essential reference guide to land use competition.

70 <--> The Golden Age of the Quantity Theory: The Development of Neoclassical Monetary Economics. 1870-1914
http://nitroflare.com/view/7FE82DE59D05E2D/0691603316.pdf
https://filejoker.net/pqqnptntd1fe


David E.W. Laidler, "The Golden Age of the Quantity Theory: The Development of Neoclassical Monetary Economics. 1870-1914" 
English | ISBN: 0691603316 | 2014 | 237 pages | PDF | 11 MB

How did neoclassical monetary economics, as epitomized by the work of Fisher, Wicksell, and the Cambridge School, evolve from the classical orthodoxy that dominated economics in the 1870s? To answer this question, David Laidler considers the interaction of theoretical developments with contemporary policy debates about bimetallism and the evolution of the gold exchange standard. He argues that neoclassical monetary economics, in which the quantity theory of money played a central role, laid the intellectual groundwork for the replacement of the gold standard by various managed monetary systems in the years following World War I. Laidler is one of the world's foremost experts on monetary economics, and this book provides an illuminating account and analysis of one of the most important periods in the development of that field. Scholars of the history of economic thought and all monetary economists will find that The Golden Age of the Quantity Theory is the most systematic treatment of the development of monetary economics between 1870 and 1914 currently available.

Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business By Charles Duhigg
2016 | 400 Pages | ISBN: 081299339X | EPUB | 2 MB


"NEW YORK TIMES "BESTSELLER From the author of "The Power of Habit "comes a fascinating book that explores the science of productivity, and why managing "how" you think is more important than "what" you think with an appendix of real-world lessons to apply to your life. At the core of "Smarter Faster Better" are eight key productivity concepts from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don t merely act differently. They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. A young woman drops out of a PhD program and starts playing poker. By training herself to envision contradictory futures, she learns to anticipate her opponents missteps and becomes one of the most successful players in the world. A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function, and find that "how" a group interacts is more important than "who" is in the group a principle, it turns out, that also helps explain why "Saturday Night Live" became a hit. A Marine Corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp and discovers that instilling a bias toward action can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers. The filmmakers behind Disney s "Frozen" are nearly out of time and on the brink of catastrophe until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. What do these people have in common? They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions; the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore; the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation; the way we interact with data: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive.

Step 2 – The Bait
Now that you’ve selected a niche, it’s time to create the web page where you’ll collect emails and build your list. This web page is called an opt-in page. In this module you’ll learn ALL ABOUT what makes an opt-in page work – this is VERY important, I suggest you take your time on this one and go through it a few times.

Here’s what you’re going to learn:

74 <--> Dull Disasters?
http://avxhome.in/blogs/AlenMiler
http://nitroflare.com/view/08AA2072BF29730/0198785577.pdf


Dull Disasters?: How planning ahead will make a difference by Daniel J. Clarke
English | 14 July 2016 | ISBN: 0198785577 | 160 Pages | PDF (True) | 1.26 MB

This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY 3.0 IGO licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. In recent years, typhoons have struck the Philippines and Vanuatu; earthquakes have rocked Haiti, Pakistan, and Nepal; floods have swept through Pakistan and Mozambique; droughts have hit Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia; and more. All led to loss of life and loss of livelihoods, and recovery will take years. One of the likely effects of climate change is to increase the likelihood of the type of extreme weather events that seems to cause these disasters. But do extreme events have to turn into disasters with huge loss of life and suffering? 

Dull Disasters? harnesses lessons from finance, political science, economics, psychology, and the natural sciences to show how countries and their partners can be far better prepared to deal with disasters. The insights can lead to practical ways in which governments, civil society, private firms, and international organizations can work together to reduce the risks to people and economies when a disaster looms. Responses to disasters then become less emotional, less political, less headline-grabbing, and more business as usual and effective. 

The book takes the reader through a range of solutions that have been implemented around the world to respond to disasters. It gives an overview of the evidence on what works and what doesn't and it examines the crucial issue of disaster risk financing. Building on the latest evidence, it presents a set of lessons and principles to guide future thinking, research, and practice in this area.

Rank YouTube videos with a simple but revolutionary course! Trying to rank YouTube videos consistently isn't nearly as easy as they make it seem, is it?
I bet this sounds familiar… You've:
Tried every new method that finds its way to your inbox.
Attempted to use sophisticated link building tools.
Spent hours hunting down "high quality" link sources.
… and they didn't work, took too much time, and left you frustrated.

But There Is Good News!
Hey there, my name is Bradley Benner and yes, I know exactly how you're feeling…
These days, I've managed to achieve quite a bit of success…
I'm able to rank YouTube videos quickly, consistently, and with confidence…
I post my videos to dozens of high quality and high authority web 2.0 and social media sites on AUTOPILOT…
And I'm very lucky in that I can provide this as a service to clients, charge a hefty price for setting this up, and pay an outsourcer to do all of the work!

But I'll be honest…
Things Definitely Didn't Start Out This Way…
Before I ever achieved even a tiny taste of success, there were a lot of roadblocks. So many times I wondered how anyone was able to make real money without having to work 14-16 hours a day…
When I first started out I still had a J.O.B. and I didn't have the the time to do everything that's required to achieve YouTube ranking success…

Things like niche/keyword research, locating potential link sources, AND creating all the videos…
I didn't know how to automate most of the SEO work so that I could continue building my empire…
And I was afraid I would never be able to scale my business to generate the kind of income I desired…
Video SEO was much more difficult than the "Gurus" said it was and took up WAY too much of my time…
I almost started thinking I would never be able to build a video SEO business that would be manageable.

know exactly what I'm talking about, am I right?
Does any of this sound familiar?

You've tried every new method that finds its way to your inbox which just resulted in a lot of money spent with no results to show for it.
You've spent hours hunting down "high quality" link sources which led to lost time that could have been better spent making more videos.
You've attempted to use sophisticated link building tools which just ended up in a poor link profile that actually hurt your rankings.

But I Wouldn't Give Up!!!
I kept testing methods until one day I discovered something that CHANGED EVERYTHING.
You can only run into so many walls before you get so frustrated that the only option left seems to be quitting.
I was just about at that point when I developed a simple method that produced outstanding results, quickly AND consistently.
As soon as I discovered this, everything got easier.
With this new level of success, I knew I couldn't keep it to myself.
Since then, I've run into many others who encountered the same, never-ending battles I went through.
And it seemed pretty unfair to keep it quiet… especially since it's been such a huge stepping stone in my success.
So I'd like to let you in on the "secret."

Introducing…
IFTTT SEO Academy

The comprehensive training course that will help you to rank YouTube videos with AWESOME results in as little as 7 days.

So what exactly is this going to do for you?
Can my simple method really turn everything around for you?
Yes. Yes it can.

Here's How the IFTTT SEO Academy Training Will Benefit You:
Automates Off-Page Video SEO - This is good for you because you'll be able to spend your time finding new opportunities to dominate new markets or rank more lead gen videos instead of spending your time trying to build links to your existing videos.
Eliminates Expensive and Complicated Software - This is important because you'll avoid the learning curve and costs associated with using SEO software tools. One of the most popular link building tools today, GSA Search Engine Ranker, can cost hundreds of dollars per month to operate: Cost of Software, VPS, Captcha Solving, Proxies, Content, Spinners, etc.
Teaches How to Use Only the Best Sites for Video Syndication - This is big because Google and YouTube love these sites, so much so that several of them are Google Social Data Hub partners (and I can prove it).
Can Be Completely Outsourced - This a good thing because it provides you with a scalable process that can be used to grow an SEO business quickly and with little of your own effort and I even have a solution for training outsources. (Details inside).
Can Even Be Used for Websites and Blogs - This is great because you can use the same methods to SEO your websites, blogs, and even client sites.

77 <--> Understanding the Mathematics of Personal Finance: An Introduction to Financial Literacy (Repost)
http://nitroflare.com/view/9804E883DA8A31B/0470497807_PersFinance.pdf
https://filejoker.net/7zgdw7kkkkwn


Lawrence N. Dworsky, "Understanding the Mathematics of Personal Finance: An Introduction to Financial Literacy" 
English | 2009 | ISBN: 0470497807 | 242 pages | PDF | 1,2 MB

A user-friendly presentation of the essential concepts and tools for calculating real costs and profits in personal finance

Understanding the Mathematics of Personal Finance explains how mathematics, a simple calculator, and basic computer spreadsheets can be used to break down and understand even the most complex loan structures. In an easy-to-follow style, the book clearly explains the workings of basic financial calculations, captures the concepts behind loans and interest in a step-by-step manner, and details how these steps can be implemented for practical purposes. Rather than simply providing investment and borrowing strategies, the author successfully equips readers with the skills needed to make accurate and effective decisions in all aspects of personal finance ventures, including mortgages, annuities, life insurance, and credit card debt.

The book begins with a primer on mathematics, covering the basics of arithmetic operations and notations, and proceeds to explore the concepts of interest, simple interest, and compound interest. Subsequent chapters illustrate the application of these concepts to common types of personal finance exchanges, including:

Loan amortization and savings

Mortgages, reverse mortgages, and viatical settlements

Prepayment penalties

Credit cards

The book provides readers with the tools needed to calculate real costs and profits using various financial instruments. Mathematically inclined readers will enjoy the inclusion of mathematical derivations, but these sections are visually distinct from the text and can be skipped without the loss of content or complete understanding of the material. In addition, references to online calculators and instructions for building the calculations involved in a spreadsheet are provided. Furthermore, a related Web site features additional problem sets, the spreadsheet calculators that are referenced and used throughout the book, and links to various other financial calculators.

Understanding the Mathematics of Personal Finance is an excellent book for finance courses at the undergraduate level. It is also an essential reference for individuals who are interested in learning how to make effective financial decisions in their everyday lives.

http://nitroflare.com/view/F0D6836177ACA18/3319023462_Plann.pdf
https://filejoker.net/mq75x1nm18hf


Demetris Demetriou, "The Development of an Integrated Planning and Decision Support System (IPDSS) for Land Consolidation" 
2014 | ISBN-10: 3319023462 | 333 pages | PDF | 9,3 MB

This book provides an extensive review of three interrelated issues: land fragmentation, land consolidation, and land reallocation, and it presents in detail the theoretical background, design, development and application of a prototype integrated planning and decision support system for land consolidation. The system integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and artificial intelligence techniques including expert systems (ES) and genetic algorithms (GAs) with multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), both multi-attribute (MADM) and multi-objective (MODM). The system is based on four modules for measuring land fragmentation; automatically generating alternative land redistribution plans; evaluating those plans; and automatically designing the land partitioning plan. The presented research provides a new scientific framework for land-consolidation planning both in terms of theory and practice, by presenting new findings and by developing better tools and methods embedded in an integrated GIS environment. It also makes a valuable contribution to the fields of GIS and spatial planning, as it provides new methods and ideas that could be applied to improve the former for the benefit of the latter in the context of planning support systems.

http://avxhome.in/blogs/Grev27
http://nitroflare.com/view/37907670B255041/047047615X.pdf


William Baker, "Endless Money: The Moral Hazards of Socialism"
English | ISBN: 047047615X | 2009 | PDF | 417 pages | 10 MB

A detailed look at how, and why, the American financial system has reached its current state

Today's economy and capital markets are faced with the long-term buildup of public and private credit. Furthermore, we face higher taxes, greater spending, and more debt. We are now at a critical crossroads and our leaders have few realistic solutions. Proposals calling for tax reforms or fewer regulations have fallen on deaf ears. In fact, U.S. democracy has become more socialist and reform is needed immediately. Endless Money is an examination of how the U.S. government and the country's financial systems have embraced socialism, and why cultural deterioration reinforces the trend and jeopardizes democracy. In it, author William Baker sees this socialism embodied in two things. The first is the socialization of income, the second is the socialization of credit.

80 <--> Social Costs and Benefits of Renewable Electricity Generation in Cyprus
http://nitroflare.com/view/D22FBDE78BFD61C/331931534X.pdf
https://filejoker.net/akkru1wgzba0


Theodoros Zachariadis, "Social Costs and Benefits of Renewable Electricity Generation in Cyprus" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 331931534X | 56 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This book presents an economic cost-benefit assessment of the penetration of renewable power generation in Cyprus up to 2030. Unlike a purely financial appraisal, we employ a social cost-benefit analysis that is mainly relevant for policy makers, taking into account – apart from direct financial costs – external costs and benefits from the diffusion of renewable electricity. The book presents a comprehensive yet straightforward case study, probably the first one conducted for Cyprus.

Electricity produced by renewable sources increased worldwide at its fastest rate to date in 2014. Driven by policies to mitigate climate change, enhance energy security and reduce air pollution, and by declining costs of major technologies, renewables account for almost all net new power generating capacity in the developed world. In this context, Cyprus is increasingly adopting renewable power generation as well. In addition to its energy and environmental commitments as a member of the European Union, the country wishes to diversify its energy supply in order to drive down electricity costs and reduce energy supply risks. A significant deployment of renewable electricity is foreseen in the coming decades. Is it economically justified for a small country with an isolated electric system like Cyprus.

From Ethical Review to Responsible Research and Innovation
Wiley-ISTE | Business & Finance | June 13 2016 | ISBN-10: 1848219156 | 206 pages | pdf | 3.12 mb

by Sophie Pellé (Author), Bernard Reber (Author)

The scientific and technological upheavals of the 20th Century and the questions and difficulties that went along with them (climate change, nuclear energy, GMO, etc.) have increased the necessity of thinking about and formalizing technoscientific progress and its consequences. Expert evaluations and ethics committees today cannot be the only legitimate sources for understanding the social acceptability and desirability of this progress. Responsibility must be shared out on a wider scale, as much in society as in the process of research and innovation projects.

This book presents the main works of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) from a moral responsibility point of view, for which it calls upon no fewer than 10 understandings to bring out those which are positive and to support an interpretive and combinatory pluralism. In this sense, it demonstrates moral innovation. It analyzes numerous cases and proposes perspectives that are rarely discussed in this emerging field (current practices of ethical evaluation, concerns of the integrity of research, means for participatory technological evaluation, etc.). It contributes to the pledges of RRI, which largely remains theoretically undetermined even though it reorganizes the relationships between science, innovation and society.

The Economic Singularity: Artificial Intelligence and the Death of Capitalism [Audiobook] by Calum Chace
English | July 27, 2016 | ASIN: B01J4K2SIS | MP3@64 kbps | 7 hrs 15 mins | 197 MB
Narrator: Joe Hempel | Genre: Nonfiction/Economics

Artificial intelligence (AI) is overtaking our human ability to absorb and process information. Robots are becoming increasingly dexterous, flexible, and safe to be around (except the military ones). AI is our most powerful technology, and you need to understand it.

This new book from best-selling author Calum Chace argues that within a few decades, most humans will not be able to work for money. Self-driving cars will probably be the canary in the coal mine, providing a wake-up call for everyone who isn't yet paying attention. All jobs will be affected, from fast food McJobs to lawyers and journalists. This is the single most important development facing humanity in the first half of the 21st century.

The fashionable belief that universal basic income is the solution is only partly correct. We are probably going to need an entirely new economic system, and we better start planning soon - for the economic singularity!

The outcome can be very good; a world in which machines do all the boring jobs and humans do pretty much what they please. But there are major risks, which we can only avoid by being alert to the possible futures and planning how to avoid the negative ones.

Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) in Bangladesh
Springer | Forestry | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 331942386X | 176 pages | pdf | 4.49 mb

Authors: Nath, Tapan Kumar, Jashimuddin, Mohammed, Inoue, Makoto
An evidence-based work that evaluates various CBFM practices on the basis of extensive field data sets
Critically analyzes current CBFM practices and outlines important policy implications
Includes detailed research methods researchers can adopt in similar studies

The book is immensely beneficial to the readers to have a clear understanding of various CBFM practices prevailing in Bangladesh.Providing a comprehensive and critical analysis of success stories concerning several CBFM practices in different forest areas of Bangladesh, together with their respective strengths and weaknesses, it identifies sharing authority to take decision by the community as one of the main weaknesses. The other main weakness is the lack of beat level authority to coordinate with community for making the process vibrant. The book determines that it is the community patrol group which is most effective under the co-management system, yet the general body and executive committee of the co-management system are composed of different stakeholders, each of which is subject to their own work pressures, and are not as effective as claimed. There is a need to empower communities living in and around forests, and to create ownership of the forests so that they can feel that the forests around them are by the community and for the community.

A History of Macroeconomics from Keynes to Lucas and Beyond By Michel De Vroey
2016 | 448 Pages | ISBN: 1107584949 , 0521898439 | PDF | 15 MB


This book retraces the history of macroeconomics from Keynes's General Theory to the present. Central to it is the contrast between a Keynesian era and a Lucasian - or dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) - era, each ruled by distinct methodological standards. In the Keynesian era, the book studies the following theories: Keynesian macroeconomics, monetarism, disequilibrium macroeconomics (Patinkin, Leijongufvud and Clower), non-Walrasian equilibrium models, and first-generation new Keynesian models. Three stages are identified in the DSGE era: new classical macroeconomics (Lucas), RBC modelling, and second-generation new Keynesian modeling. The book also examines a few selected works aimed at presenting alternatives to Lucasian macroeconomics. While not eschewing analytical content, Michel De Vroey focuses on substantive assessments, and the models studied are presented in a pedagogical and vivid yet critical way.

Springer VS | Sociology | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3658145978 | 199 pages | pdf | 4.44 mb

Authors: Hahn, Sophie
Study in Social Science

Sophie Hahn analyses downward mobility in educational attainment from a sociological life-course perspective. In order to avoid status loss children of higher-educated parents have to persevere through long educational careers. How large is their risk of intergenerational downward mobility in educational attainment and how does it shape their educational pathways? Does their parents’ education still play a role in decisions at late stages of the educational career such as dropping out of and re-entering higher education? Drawing on retrospective longitudinal data of the German National Education Panel Study (NEPS) this book addresses these questions.

Contributors use the methodologies of religious studies to provide descriptions and comparisons of perspectives from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam on poverty and wealth. The book presents citations from the sacred texts of all three religions. The contributors discuss the interpretations of these texts and the necessary contexts, both past and present, for deciphering the stances found there. Poverty and Wealth in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam identifies and details a foundation of common values upon which individual and institutional decisions may be made.

The quality of the avi's are a perfect master from the vhs tapes however the quality featured in the course are from the 50's and leave a little to be desired. Having said that, they feature Napoleon Hill and if you've never seen him speak in an archival sense, now's your chance. This is an excellent program which will bring you back to the roots of the self-help movement. W. Clement Stone's intermittent apprearances are interesting as they feature him from the early 1990's when the course was produced…
Whether you are striving for achievement in your career or personal life, Napoleon Hill and W. Clement Stone share the universal philosophies that lead you directly to the source of all life's riches.

Developed from rare archival film footage from the 1950's, this powerful video course explains a success system that is virtually failproof! In 13 dynamic sessions, Dr. Hill will show you how you can use the principles of success he discovered by analyzing the success of more than 500 of the 20th century's greatest achievers.
Each of the 13 sessions is introduced by world-renowned multimillionaire, W.Clement Stone, who was Dr. Hill's general manager and a close personal friend. Now these secrets of success are passed on to you. This video course shows you how to achieve all your goals with lifechanging consistency.

Dr. Napoleon Hill
Perhaps no person in history has influenced the success of more individuals than Napoleon Hill. He was asked by the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie to organize the world's first philosophy of individual achievement. The project, based on the success principles of Carnegie and other great achievers of the time, took 20 years to complete. Hill wrote several books based on his research, including the classics Think and Grow Rich, The Science of Personal Achievement and Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, the latter co-authored with W.Clement Stone. All are available on audiocassette from
Nightingale-Conant.

W. Clement Stone
Much more than an insurance magnate, W.Clement Stone is a philanthropist, a civic leader, an author and publisher and a 1981 Nobel Peace Prize nominee. He is known to high achievers everywhere as the father of PMA (Positive Mental Attitude), a philosophy he has carried to millions through self-help books,
audio and video recordings and magazine articles. Greatly influenced as a young man by Napoleon Hill, Stone has achieved one stunning success after another.

Springer | Business & Management | August 29, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319396536 | 232 pages | pdf | 3.86 mb

Editors: Trąpczyński, Piotr, Puślecki, Łukasz, Jarosiński, Mirosław (Eds.)
Contains latest empirical data on recent developments in international business in the region of Central and Eastern Europe
Blends two complementary and interrelated perspectives, at economy and firm-levels, under one common problem of competitiveness in middle-income regions
Constitutes a valuable reading for students, researchers and policy makers dealing with international business

This book presents peer-reviewed, state-of-the-art conceptual and empirical papers devoted to changes in the international competitive position of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) region, its countries and businesses. While the unprecedented scale of transformation in the CEE region has provided a distinct research setting for international business and economics scholars for more than two decades, there have also been recent discussions about the extent to which the region continues to have a unique business environment. The region's economies have reached different levels of market development and modern business practice adoption, with some of them now frequently classified as advanced economies. Consequently, the same level of heterogeneity among CEE countries can also be observed at the sector and business level. 
The contributions in this book highlight possible sources of competitive advantage for CEE countries and firms, in light of recent intensive debates about the danger of the middle-income trap and the potential solutions to it.

Promoting Sustainable Innovations in Plant Varieties
Springer | Law | Oct. 6 2016 | ISBN-10: 3662527952 | 339 pages | pdf | 3.59 mb

Authors: Kochupillai, Mrinalini
Explains the importance of Sustainable Innovations concept using data collected through interviews with more than 150 farmers in an important agrobiodiversity hotspot 
Studies means of promoting 'sustainable innovations' in plant varieties from a multi-disciplinary perspective
Provides unique and new philosophical, legal, historical and empirical insights into the field of agricultural seed related innovations and adopts a novel methodology that can be duplicated and developed in future research

This book develops the term ‘Sustainable Innovations’ and defines it on the basis of plant variety innovations that, by their very nature, (i) permit the in situ conservation of agrobiodiversity and genetic variability in diverse geographic and climatic conditions, (ii) do not exclude any potential innovators from the process of innovation, and thereby (iii) ensure that both formal and informal innovations can continue to take place in the generations to come (in both the developed and developing world). The book studies the Indian Plant Variety Protection Act, the UPOV Acts and associated agricultural policies from a legal, philosophical, historical and economic perspective with the aim of determining the means of promoting sustainable innovations in plant varieties and identifying laws, policies and practices that are currently acting as impediments to promoting the same.

Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus By Jeffrey M. Perloff
2007 | 800 Pages | ISBN: 0321468589 | scanned PDF | 51 MB


Professors teaching this course have two concurrent goals: to teach the microeconomic tools students need for future coursework and careers, and to encourage students to work problems. In Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus, Perloff brings his hallmark pedagogy to the calculus-based course by integrating Solved Problems and real, data-driven applications in every chapter. This new text offers a serious presentation of calculus-based microeconomic theory and offers a suite of carefully crafted, calculus-based problem sets at the end of each chapter. Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus covers basic and modern theories first, and then offers advanced theory chapters at the end. By providing graphical representation and real-world applications to illustrate the theory, Perloff demonstrates how individuals, policy makers, and firms use microeconomic tools to analyze and resolve problems. Perloff’s algebra-based Microeconomics, now in its Fourth Edition, has become a market leader because it clearly introduces theory and helps students develop problem-solving skills through its Solved Problem feature.

Un anno sognato pericolosamente - Slavoj Žižek
Italian | 2013 | 189 Pages | ISBN: 8862207638 | EPUB | 259.34 KB

Siamo entrati in un'epoca di rivolgimenti politici e sociali cui mai avremmo creduto di poter assistere, un'epoca segnata dalla ripresa delle lotte di emancipazione su scala generale - si pensi alla Primavera araba e al movimento Occupy - ma anche dal ridestarsi di potenti forze antidemocratiche: il sentimento xenofobo e integralista che dilaga in Europa, e che è sfociato nella follia omicida di Breivik, autore della strage di Utoya; i governi "politicamente neutri" dei tecnici in Italia, Grecia e Spagna, senza escludere la riedizione dell'ossimoro contemporaneo per eccellenza, ossia la guerra umanitaria (in Libia). È stato un anno sognato pericolosamente, in cui agli straordinari slanci di partecipazione democratica hanno fatto da controcanto le misure di iniquo "risanamento" imposte alla collettività dai sicari dell'economia. Slavoj Zizek ci propone un'attenta e originale lettura di questi eventi, unitamente all'esame di alcuni tra i più significativi fenomeni culturali del momento, per fare luce sull'"antagonismo centrale del capitalismo contemporaneo". Abbinando il giudizio appassionato del militante politico al contegno filosofico del critico dell'ideologia, Zizek cerca di rispondere alla domanda cruciale del nostro tempo: come possiamo combattere il sistema senza contribuire, involontariamente, al suo rafforzamento?

2015 | 480 Pages | ISBN: 0198706200 | PDF | 2 MB


In the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession of 2008 to 2013, the economic debate has begun to shift towards 'rebalancing' the UK economy, away from an over-reliance upon consumerism and the financial sector to generate growth, towards more sustainable productive activities. The fallout from the financial crisis exposed the systemic failings of the dominant neo-liberal model to deliver balanced growth and there is now increasing recognition this 'rebalancing' might best be achieved through the state pursuing an active 'industrial policy'. Thus, after a long hiatus, industrial policy is back in vogue at regional, national, and EU levels driven by concerns over competitiveness, globalisation, de-industrialisation, unemployment, and the comparatively slow growth of the British and EU economies especially in this post-recession phase. At the same time, industrial policy has been seen as a catalyst for designing economic recovery strategies at regional, national, and EU levels as well as being a concerted strategy to develop new 'clean-tech' industries to tackle environmental challenges. This book brings together leading European based experts, each with a long standing interest in industrial policy. The chapters offer a broad set of perspectives on the many facets of industrial policy, including reflections upon past experiences of industrial policy (from across the globe) and critical analysis and advice upon contemporary UK industrial policy issues. They aim to critically inform and challenge policy-makers, policy think-tanks, industrialists, trade unions, academics, and other stakeholders in framing the future course for industrial policy in the UK, and indeed more widely.

The Future of Strategy: A Transformative Approach to Strategy for a World That Won't Stand Still By Johan Aurik, Martin Fabel
2015 | 240 Pages | ISBN: 0071848746 | PDF | 4 MB


Own the Future of Your Industry with a Transformational Strategy Designed for Today's Business World Leaders today are inundated with strategic opportunities, besieged by business disruptions, andpressured to innovate--to do things better, faster, or differently. The CEO of a Fortune 500 firm explains it best: "I am looking at 23 different strategic initiatives. Trying to develop and implement so many strategies is like trying to change the driver, tires, the oil, and the bumpers; paint the body; and tune the engine. And doing all of this on a car that's running at full speed." The answer used to be found in strategy. But in thepast decade, the commonly deployed large-scale strategic exercises were largely discredited. They were slow and elaborate and did not deliver the expected returns, let alone help make sense of a glut of initiatives or cope with an increasingly unpredictable future. The Future of Strategy brings strategy back fromthose big top-down plans. It answers the questions of executives facing tumultuous business conditions and rapidly shifting markets: Is strategy still possible? Yes. Aren't strategies outdated before they can be implemented? Not if they are done right. Rather than developing strategy, aren't we better off being agile and able to capitalize on emerging trends faster than our peers? Agility complements strategy; it cannot replace it. This book is about reversing course and repositioningstrategy in its rightful place as the overarchingmanagement system. The authors introduce their core methodology, designed to future proof companies against the friction and "fog of war" that inexorably accompany changing times. They synthesize three fundamental principles that, when combined, provide the means to reclaim strategy: Take direct cues from fundamental trends affecting the company going forward Engage people across the company to translate these cues into strategy and effectively eliminate the handover hurdle between formulation and execution, a major reason for strategy failure Capture the output as competitive opportunities and manage their life cycles--when some have run their course, others are ready to take over Strategy today requires stepping over the shadows of one's own ingrained beliefs to capture new opportunities.This book reveals the inner workings of transformational strategies developed by leaders who gradually become more successful by advancing winning combinations of attitudes, values, habits, and practices.

English | ISBN: 0521850258, 0521369924 | 2005 | 550 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Building on The Dynamics of Keynesian Monetary Growth by Chiarella and Flaschel (2000), this 2005 book is a key contribution to business cycle theory, setting out a disequilibrium approach with gradual adjustments of the key macroeconomic variables. Its analytic study of a deterministic model of economic activity, inflation and income distribution integrates elements in the tradition of Keynes, Metzler and Goodwin (KMG). After a qualitative analysis of the basic feedback mechanisms, the authors calibrate the KMG model to the stylized facts of the business cycle in the U.S. economy, and then undertake a detailed numerical investigation of the local and global dynamics generated by the model. Finally, topical issues in monetary policy are studied in small macromodels as well as for the KMG model by incorporating an estimated Taylor-type interest rate reaction function. The stability features of this enhanced model are also compared to those of the original KMG model.

Managing business risks in the 21st century New Economy is very different to managing risk in the closing years of the 20th century.

In her enlightening new book, Pamela Shimell talks to top managers from the world's leading multinationals who have successfully managed these challenges to corporate survival as well as some that have had a baptism of fire. The Universe of Risk provides a comprehensive, colourful guide to risk management, incorporating the new drivers of risk, and a fresh model for business success. Executives featured in The Universe of Risk include: Steven A. Ballmer, President and CEO, Microsoft Corporation Arthur C. Ciccolo, Department Group Manager, Information and Knowledge Management, IBM Allan Leighton, CEO, Going Plural, Chairman, lastminute.com, and bhs Sir Peter Michael, Founder, Classic FM Peter Morgan, Chairman, Baltimore Technologies David Gamble, Executive Director, AIRMIC Peter Morris, Global Head of Information Risk Management, KPMG Brian Fullerton, Global Director of Risk Management, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers Jon Symonds, Chief Financial Officer, AstraZeneca Heiko Haasler, Brand Manager, De La Rue Philip Thomas, Director, Risk Management, Bass Richard Gossage, Head of Group Risk, Royal Bank of Scotland Group "Shimell's book is an important addition to the business library.

David Walker, "Comeback America: Turning the Country Around and Restoring Fiscal Responsibility" 
English | 2010 | 272 Pages | ISBN: 0812980727 | EPUB | 2 MB

He's one of America's most capable, canny, candid, and independent financial experts. Now David M. Walker sounds a call to action. Comeback America is a tough-minded, innovative, inspiring guide to help us avoid the approaching economic abyss and put the country back on track again.

As comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO)—"the nation's top auditor"—Walker warned Congress and the administration as the federal surplus became a giant deficit under George W. Bush. As president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, he now works full-time to raise public awareness regarding mounting debt burdens being imposed on future generations. Comeback America is his crucial manifesto, a way for President Obama to end out-of-control government spending and reform our tax, retirement, health care, defense, and other systems—before it's too late.

Walker believes that by 2030, absent significant reforms to current government programs and policies, federal taxes could double from current levels, meaning less money and poorer education for kids—which will hurt families along with our nation's economic strength and position in the world. If our foreign creditors—such as China—decide to buy fewer of our Treasury bonds, interest rates will rise and cars and homes will become less affordable. 

But it doesn't have to be that way. Comeback America shows how we can return to our founding principles of fiscal responsibility and stewardship for future generations. The book includes bold ideas to control spending, save Social Security, dramatically alter Medicare, and simplify the tax code—all taking into account the Obama Administration's current efforts, which receive never-before-published assessments both complimentary and critical.

Nonpartisan, nonideological, and filled with a love of the country its esteemed author has spent his life serving, Comeback America is a book for anyone interested in America's economic future—in other words, a book everyone should read.

Simon Kuznets, E. Glen Weyl, "Jewish Economies (Volume 2): Development and Migration in America and Beyond: Comparative Perspectives on Jewish Migration" 
2012 | ISBN-10: 1412842700 | 295 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Nobel Laureate Simon Kuznets, famous as the founder of modern empirical economics, pioneered the quantitative study of the economic history of the Jews. Yet, until now, his most important work on the subject was unpublished. This second collection of previously unavailable material issued by Transaction brings to the public, for the first time, the most important economic work written on Jewish migration since that of Werner Sombart a century ago.

This volume of Kuznets’ work includes three main essays. The first, titled “Immigration and the Foreign Born,” was Kuznets’ first work on immigration and discusses the impact of the general foreign born on the U.S. Kuznets and his co-author, Ernest Rubin, offer the essay as a quantitative antidote to the misinformation that led many Jews to support the restrictions ending Jewish migration in the 1920s. The second, “Israel’s Economic Development,” discusses the impact of mass immigration and other factors on Israeli productivity, providing in English for the first time one of the first detailed studies of the economic development of the state of Israel. The final essay, on “Immigration of Russian Jews to the United States,” is the most famous of Kuznets’ writings and provides a clear view, backed by a seminal paper that launched the contemporary social scientific study of Jewry. It discusses the details of the labor force, skills, and general structure of Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the U.S.

Alex Moazed, Nicholas L. Johnson, "Modern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy" 
2016 | ISBN: 1250091896 | 272 pages | EPUB, MOBI, AZW3 | 7 MB

What do Google, Snapchat, Tinder, Amazon, and Uber have in common, besides soaring market share? They're platforms - a new business model that has quietly become the only game in town, creating vast fortunes for its founders while dominating everyone's daily life. A platform, by definition, creates value by facilitating an exchange between two or more interdependent groups. So, rather that making things, they simply connect people.

The Internet today is awash in platforms - Facebook is responsible for nearly 25 percent of total Web visits, and the Google platform crash in 2013 took about 40 percent of Internet traffic with it. Representing the ten most trafficked sites in the U.S., platforms are also prominent over the globe; in China, they hold the top eight spots in web traffic rankings.

The advent of mobile computing and its ubiquitous connectivity have forever altered how we interact with each other, melding the digital and physical worlds and blurring distinctions between "offline" and "online." These platform giants are expanding their influence from the digital world to the whole economy. Yet, few people truly grasp the radical structural shifts of the last ten years. In Modern Monopolies, Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson tell the definitive story of what has changed, what it means for businesses today, and how managers, entrepreneurs, and business owners can adapt and thrive in this new era.

All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis [Audiobook] by Bethany McLean, Joe Nocera
English | November 16, 2010 | ASIN: B004CJN7AU | MP3@64 kbps | 15 hrs 33 mins | 425 MB
Narrator: Dennis Boutsikaris | Genre: Nonfiction/Economics

As soon as the financial crisis erupted, the finger-pointing began. Should the blame fall on Wall Street, Main Street, or Pennsylvania Avenue? On greedy traders, misguided regulators, sleazy subprime companies, cowardly legislators, or clueless home buyers?

According to Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, two of America's most acclaimed business journalists, the real answer is all of the above-and more. Many devils helped bring hell to the economy. And the full story, in all of its complexity and detail, is like the legend of the blind men and the elephant. Almost everyone has missed the big picture. Almost no one has put all the pieces together.

All the Devils Are Here goes back several decades to weave the hidden history of the financial crisis in a way no previous book has done. It explores the motivations of everyone from famous CEOs, cabinet secretaries, and politicians to anonymous lenders, borrowers, analysts, and Wall Street traders. It delves into the powerful American mythology of homeownership. And it proves that the crisis ultimately wasn't about finance at all; it was about human nature.

The Scam, a chronicle of two of the most famous scams in the Indian stock markets, is now back in a digital avatar. The story told by Sucheta Dalal and Debashis Basu, can't find a more credible and informed couple of storytellers for these events. First published in April 1993, the book was an immediate bestseller but had been out of print for a while. 
This 8th edition of the scam includes the original Harshad Mehta Scam and the Ketan Parekh Scam, while also delving into the JPC Fiasco and the Global Trust Bank Scam. The basic question that the book deals with is, "what really happened in the two great Indian scams?" The answer to this question, detailed in the book, brings up another important one, "Have we learnt anything since, so that such things don't happen again?"

Loretta Napoleoni, "Economia canaglia: Il lato oscuro del nuovo ordine mondiale"
Publisher: Saggiatore | 2009 | ISBN: 8856501082 | Italian | EPUB | 310 pages | 0.3 Mb

I consumatori vivono oggi in un mondo virtuale idilliaco costruito dai media. Intrappolati in una fitta ragnatela di chimere economiche e politiche, i cittadini ne sono spesso (e inconsapevolmente) parte integrante. Ma la realtà economica globale è un pianeta che muta con sconcertante intensità e rapidità. A gestirlo è l'economia canaglia, una forza indomabile in mano a nuove generazioni di spregiudicati uomini d'affari, imprenditori e finanzieri. I cittadini alimentano un subdolo meccanismo che li danneggia. Ma tutto ciò è già successo. Attraverso esempi concreti, Loretta Napoleoni descrive l'avvento e la diffusione dell'economia canaglia, invitando ad aprire gli occhi e a conoscere veramente il mondo in cui viviamo: dalla caduta del Muro di Berlino, attraverso gli anni novanta, la rivoluzione cibernetica, il diffondersi della pirateria fino alla tragedia delle Torri Gemelle e alla costruzione dell'impero economico cinese e di quello finanziario islamico.

Five Easy Theses: Commonsense Solutions to America's Greatest Economic Challenges by James Stone
2016 | ISBN: 0544749006 | English | 288 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

A business leader and esteemed economic thinker outlines simple solutions to America’s five most pressing public policy issues, from healthcare to education to inequality.

America today confronts a host of urgent problems, many of them seemingly intractable, but some we are entirely capable of solving. In Five Easy Theses, James M. Stone presents specific, common-sense solutions to a handful of our most pressing challenges, showing how simple it would be to shore up Social Security, rein in an out-of-control financial sector, reduce inequality, and make healthcare and education better and more affordable. The means are right in front of us, Stone explains, in various policy options that — if implemented — could preserve or enhance government revenue while also channeling the national economy toward the greater good. 

Accessible and thought provoking, Five Easy Theses reveals that a more democratic, prosperous America is well within our reach.

Corporate Valuation: Measuring the Value of Companies in Turbulent Times
Wiley | Corporate Finance | Aug. 8 2016 | ISBN-10: 1119003334 | 509 pages | pdf | 10.1 mb

by Mario Massari (Author), Gianfranco Gianfrate (Author), Laura Zanetti (Author)

Risk consideration is central to more accurate post-crisis valuation
Corporate Valuation presents the most up-to-date tools and techniques for more accurate valuation in a highly volatile, globalized, and risky business environment. This insightful guide takes a multidisciplinary approach, considering both accounting and financial principles, with a practical focus that uses case studies and numerical examples to illustrate major concepts. Readers are walked through a map of the valuation approaches proven most effective post-crisis, with explicit guidance toward implementation and enhancement using advanced tools, while exploring new models, techniques, and perspectives on the new meaning of value. Risk centrality and scenario analysis are major themes among the techniques covered, and the companion website provides relevant spreadsheets, models, and instructor materials.

Business is now done in a faster, more diverse, more interconnected environment, making valuation an increasingly more complex endeavor. New types of risks and competition are shaping operations and finance, redefining the importance of managing uncertainty as the key to success. This book brings that perspective to bear in valuation, providing new insight, new models, and practical techniques for the modern finance industry.

Gain a new understanding of the idea of "value," from both accounting and financial perspectives
Learn new valuation models and techniques, including scenario-based valuation, the Monte Carlo analysis, and other advanced tools
Understand valuation multiples as adjusted for risk and cycle, and the decomposition of deal multiples
Examine the approach to valuation for rights issues and hybrid securities, and more
Traditional valuation models are inaccurate in that they hinge on the idea of ensured success and only minor adjustments to forecasts. These rules no longer apply, and accurate valuation demands a shift in the paradigm. Corporate Valuation describes that shift, and how it translates to more accurate methods.

Code of Practice for Programme Management in the Built Environment

This is the first Code of Practice for Programme Management for the Built Environment. It is a natural development from the highly successful Code of Practice for Project Management for Construction & Development, which was first published in 1992 and is currently in its Fifth Edition. Both Codes of Practice were developed by representatives from the major professional Institutions associated with the built environment including the CIOB, RICS, RIBA, ICE and APM, as well as from key government departments, domestic and international corporations and the university sector. By aligning, coordinating and managing a number of related projects as a programme, benefits which would not have been possible to realise had the projects been managed independently can be delivered. This Code of Practice is intended to provide practical coverage of the general processes and procedures to be followed when managing such a programme. It sets out the necessary requirements for effective and efficient programme management, while at the same time ensuring systematic quality control and documentation through governance arrangements. Written for programme and project management professionals in construction, whether working as contractors or clients, the book will also be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of construction and related disciplines.

138 <--> Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier (Repost)

Edward Glaeser, "Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier" 
English | 2011 | ISBN: 159420277X, 0143120549, 1101467339 | 352 pages | PDF, MOBI | 2 MB

Glaeser's academic specialty, urban economics, informs his survey of how cities around the world thrive and wither. Using a range of expository forms history, biography, economic research, and personal story he defines what makes a city successful. That changes through time, and a flourishing Industrial Age model may not work in the service-age economy, as rust-belt towns like Detroit have learned. One thing constantly attracts people to one city rather than another how much housing construction is permitted. Restrictive places, such as New York City, coastal California, and Paris, have a tight housing supply with prices only the wealthy can afford. Hence, middle-class people move to the suburbs or cities like Houston. Other features of metropolises their incidences of poverty and crime, traffic congestion, quality of schools, and cultural amenities also figure in Glaeser's analysis. Whatever the city under discussion, Mumbai or Woodlands, Texas, Glaeser is discerning and independent; for example, he believes that historic preservation isn't an unalloyed good and that bigger, denser cities militate against global warming. Thought-provoking material for urban-affairs students.

139 <--> The Moral Rhetoric of Political Economy: Justice and Modern Economic Thought (Repost)

Paul Turpin, "The Moral Rhetoric of Political Economy: Justice and Modern Economic Thought" 
English | 2011 | ISBN: 041577392X | 192 pages | PDF | 1,3 MB

This book examines the effects of the moral rhetoric of the market concept of justice on our understanding of justice. Market theory’s elevation of the role of commutative justice, or justice in exchange and property, is often taken as liberalism’s revolutionary change in priorities of justice in parting from the feudal world. This change has come at the expense of diminishing the role of distributive justice, or justice in what the community owes its members. This diminishment rules out discussion in the public sphere of any questions about our obligations to each other outside the market, relegating such questions instead to the purview of social decorum; so at the very historical moment in which equality of persons becomes the foundational condition for political liberty, the implications of that equality for how we should treat each other cease to be admissible as live political issues – that is, discussable as justice.


This shift in elevating commutative justice is traced through the moral rhetoric of praise and blame in the political economy of Adam Smith and Milton Friedman. Their theories of the market serve to implicitly position social and market decorum alongside an explicit commutative framework as the condition for a naturally self-regulating market. Their appeal to decorum is presented as a naturally occurring source of social stability. The book examines how these fundamental features of the economic argument represented by Smith and Friedman appear influentially in moral and political philosophy, among critics as well as supporters of the market system. The consistent problem is the persistent neglect of the genesis of individual identity’s constitution in community, resulting in an overvaluation of individualism and an under-acknowledgement of the significance of belonging. Resolving this problem must necessarily focus on making relational complaints about justice part of public discussion again.


This book should be of interest to graduate students and researchers looking at communication or rhetoric in the history of economic thought, political thought as well as moral philosophy and ethics.

Inside the Investments of Warren Buffett: Twenty Cases (Columbia Business School Publishing) by Yefei Lu
2016 | ISBN: 0231164629 | English | 312 pages | PDF | 15 MB

Since the 1950s, Warren Buffett and his partners have backed some of the twentieth century's most profitable, trendsetting companies. But how did they know they were making the right investments? What did Buffet and his partners look for in an up-and-coming company, and how can others replicate their approach?

A gift to Buffett followers who have long sought a pattern to the investor's success, Inside the Investments of Warren Buffett presents the most detailed analysis to date of Buffet's long-term investment portfolio. Yefei Lu, an experienced investor, starts with Buffett's interest in the Sanborn Map Company in 1958 and tracks nineteen more of his major investments in companies like See's Candies, the Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, US Air, Wells Fargo, and IBM. Accessing partnership letters, company documents, annual reports, third-party references, and other original sources, Lu pinpoints what is unique about Buffett's timing, instinct, use of outside knowledge, and postinvestment actions, and he identifies what could work well for all investors in companies big and small, domestic and global. His substantial chronology accounts for broader world events and fluctuations in the U.S. stock market, suggesting Buffett's most important trait may be the breadth of his expertise.

Lecturer: Professor Daniel W. Drezner | Subject: Economics

Prosperity has transformed the world. But the story of prosperity is far from simple-or complete. These 24 lectures give you an unrivaled overview of one of the most pressing issues of our day and take you behind the headlines and into the debates to dispel some common myths about prosperity and get at deeper truths.

In this stimulating, wide-ranging course, Professor Drezner shows that achieving prosperity involves more than economics. Psychology, sociology, political science, and history also come into play. By taking this broad view, he leads you to fundamental insights about how the modern world works and an understanding of the functioning of the U.S., European, Chinese, and other major economies, as well as an appreciation for the special problems faced by underdeveloped nations.

These lectures introduce you to dozens of case histories that illustrate what works and doesn't work in the drive to increase economic growth. A superb storyteller, Professor Drezner reaches back to examples such as the policy called mercantilism that trapped European powers in growth-killing trade practices from the 16th to 18th centuries. And he anchors his analysis in the present with discussions of globalization, financial bubbles, and other economic phenomena in the news.As a start on your own road to greater prosperity, educate yourself with this unparalleled explanation of the foundations of economic prosperity.

In this urgent time, World on the Edge calls out the pivotal environmental issues and how to solve them now. We are in a race between political and natural tipping points. Can we close coal-fired power plants fast enough to save the Greenland ice sheet and avoid catastrophic sea level rise? Can we raise water productivity fast enough to halt the depletion of aquifers and avoid water-driven food shortages? Can we cope with peak water and peak oil at the same time? These are some of the issues Lester R. Brown skillfully distills in World on the Edge. Bringing decades of research and analysis into play, he provides the responses needed to reclaim our future.

Capitalism’s Future: Alienation, Emancipation and Critique
Brill | Social Sciences | May 26 2016 | ISBN-10: 9004300309 | 298 pages | pdf | 1.21 mb

by Daniel Krier (Contributor), Mark Worrell (Contributor)

"Capitalisms Future: Alienation, Emancipation and Critique" frames 21st century economic and social possibilities in a dialogue between two forms of critical social theory: Marx s "critique of political economy" that analyzes capitalism and the "critique of political psychology" that analyzes authoritarianism. Contributions from social theorists in sociology, philosophy, and cultural studies are brought together to dissect and critique capitalist crises, left-liberalism, left-Thatcherism, resistance to risk-pooling, idealist philosophy, undemocratic social character, status wages and authoritarian spectacles. Throughout, Marx s centrality to critical social theory is confirmed, both alone and in in powerful combination with Adorno, Durkheim, Dubois, Lacan, Veblen, Weber and others. This book outlines conjoined critiques of "commodity-fetishism" and "authority fetishism" as the emancipatory agenda of 21st century critical theory. Contributors are: Kevin S. Amidon, Graham Cassano, Tony A. Feldmann, Daniel Krier, Christian Lotz, Patrick Murray, David Norman Smith, Tony Smith, William J. Swart, and Mark P. Worrell."

by John Donoghue (Hi (Contributor), Evelyn P Jennings (Contributor)

"Building the Atlantic Empires" explores the relationship between state recruitment of unfree labor and capitalist and imperial development. Contributors show Western European states as agents of capitalist expansion, imposing diverse forms of bondage on workers for infrastructural, plantation, and military labor. Extending the prolific literature on racial slavery, these essays help transcend imperial, colonial, geographic, and historiographic boundaries through comparative insights into multiple forms and ideologies of unfree labor as they evolved over the course of four centuries in the Dutch, French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese empires. The book raises new questions for scholars seeking connections between the history of servitude and slavery and the ways in which capitalism and imperialism transformed the Atlantic world and beyond. Contributors are: Pepijn Brandon, Rafael Chambouleyron, James Coltrain, John Donoghue, Karwan Fatah-Black, Elizabeth Heath, Evelyn P. Jennings, and Anna Suranyi. With a foreword by Peter Way.

Wall Streeters: The Creators and Corruptors of American Finance (Columbia Business School Publishing) by Edward Morris
2015 | ISBN: 0231170548 | English | 368 pages | EPUB | 20 MB

The 2008 financial collapse, the expansion of corporate and private wealth, the influence of money in politics―many of Wall Street's contemporary trends can be traced back to the work of fourteen critical figures who wrote, and occasionally broke, the rules of American finance.

Edward Morris plots in absorbing detail Wall Street's transformation from a clubby enclave of financiers to a symbol of vast economic power. His book begins with J. Pierpont Morgan, who ruled the American banking system at the turn of the twentieth century, and ends with Sandy Weill, whose collapsing Citigroup required the largest taxpayer bailout in history. In between, Wall Streeters relates the triumphs and missteps of twelve other financial visionaries. From Charles Merrill, who founded Merrill Lynch and introduced the small investor to the American stock market; to Michael Milken, the so-called junk bond king; to Jack Bogle, whose index funds redefined the mutual fund business; to Myron Scholes, who laid the groundwork for derivative securities; and to Benjamin Graham, who wrote the book on securities analysis. Anyone interested in the modern institution of American finance will devour this history of some of its most important players.

Global Capital and National Governments suggests that international financial integration does not mean the end of social democratic welfare policies. Capital market openness allows participants to react swiftly and severely to government policy; but in the developed world, capital market participants consider only a few government policies when making decisions.

Crise économique et mondialisation obligent, l’innovation et la recherche doivent faire partie de nos priorités si nous voulons rester compétitifs. Mais décréter l’innovation ne suffit pas. Elle peut être encouragée, mais surtout elle se pratique, à travers un certain état d’esprit. Comment ? En choisissant d’adopter certaines postures, telles la confiance, le décloisonnement, la créativité, l’audace, la valorisation, l’identité. Ces six clefs directement liées à la dimension humaine constituent un repère d’efficience.Après plus d’une centaine d’entretiens en France, à Bruxelles, en Suisse, en Finlande, en Allemagne, en Corée du Sud et en Israël, les auteurs dressent des constats sur les freins et les leviers, mais ils livrent aussi des pistes créatives pour améliorer la performance collective, et finalement la cohésion sociale.

Public Economics in an Age of Austerity (The Graz Schumpeter Lectures) By Tony Atkinson
2014 | 112 Pages | ISBN: 1138018155 | PDF | 2 MB


Governments all round the world are facing problems with their public finances. At a time of austerity, how much should spending be cut and how much should taxes be raised? Does the national debt represent a burden for future generations? Should taxes on the rich be raised? This book examines how the tools of public economics can be applied to answer such key questions and to suggest alternatives to the austerity policies currently being pursued. The fiscal problems faced are not simply the result of the post-2008 economic crisis but reflect a deep-seated fault line in modern economies. There has to be fiscal consolidation to provide for an ageing population, increased investment in education, and climate change. The book describes how public economics can help us think about alternative ways of meeting this challenge. It casts doubt on conventionally held views, such as those concerned with top tax rates, the undesirability of taxing capital income, the targeting of child benefits, and the merging of income tax and social security contributions. The final part goes beyond national boundaries and considers global public economics, focusing on the pressing problem of financing development. The conclusion of the book is that there are significant choices to be made. Not all austerity packages are the same: there are alternatives. It would be possible to raise taxes more and to cut spending less. It is important to consider the full range of possible policies. In considering these alternatives, modern public economics provides a useful framework, but it has major limitations. Economists are too often prisoners within the theoretical walls they have erected and fail to see that important considerations are missing. Economists have paid too little attention to the ethical basis underlying their policy recommendations.

Liaquat Ahamed, "Die Herren des Geldes: Wie vier Bankiers die Weltwirtschaftskrise auslösten und die Welt in den Bankrott trieben" 
German | 2010 | ISBN-10: 3898795780 | 672 pages | EPUB, MOBI | 3 MB

Detailliert zeichnet Ahamed nach, wie Notenbanker Millionen von Menschen ins Verderben stürzen, wenn sie danebenliegen. Hier zeigt sich bereits eine Analogie zur heutigen Situation, denn die Fachwelt diskutiert, ob durch die weltweite Öffnung der Geldschleusen nicht bereits der Grundstein für die nächste Krise gelegt wird. Der Reiz des Buches liegt darin, dass Ahamed nicht einfach die Entstehung der Weltwirtschaftkrise 1929 beschreibt, sondern dies anhand der Persönlichkeiten von vier Notenbankern tut, die alle auf ihre Weise hochspannende Figuren waren und die Geldpolitik bis heute prägen. Ahameds Thesen sind provokativ und haben in den USA großes Aufsehen erregt. Im Kern sagen sie, dass sich Notenbanker nicht zu dogmatisch an einem Ziel festklammern sollten. Damit greift Ahamed indirekt heutige Geldpolitiker an, die unter allen Umständen die Inflation kontrollieren wollen, besonders in Europa. Ausgezeichnet mit dem Pulitzerpreis 2010!

Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, Utomo Sarjono Putro, "Systems Science for Complex Policy Making: A Study of Indonesia" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 4431552723 | 118 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This volume applies a systems science perspective to complex policy making dynamics, using the case of Indonesia to illustrate the concepts. Indonesia is an archipelago with a high heterogeneity. Her people consist of 1,340 tribes who are scattered over 17,508 islands. Every region has different natural strengths and conditions. In the national development process all regions depend on one another other while optimizing their own conditions. In addition to this diversity, Indonesia also employs a democratic system of government with high regional autonomy. A democratic government puts a high value on individual freedom, but on the other hand, conflicts of interest also occur frequently. High regional autonomy also often causes problems in coordination among agencies and regional governments. This uniqueness creates a kind of complexity that is rarely found in other countries.These daily complexities requires intensive interaction, negotiation processes, and coordination. Such necessities should be considered in public policy making and in managing the implementation of national development programs. In this context, common theories and best practices generated on the basis of more simplified assumptions often fail. Systems science offer a way of thinking that can take into account and potentially overcome these complexities. However, efforts to apply systems science massively and continuously in real policy making by involving many stakeholders are still rarely carried out. The first part of the book discusses the gap between the existing public policy-making approach and needs in the real world. After that, the characteristics of the appropriate policy-making process in a complex environment and how this process can be carried are described. In later sections, important systems science concepts that can be applied in managing these complexities are discussed. Finally, the efforts to apply these concepts in real cases in Indonesia are described.

Akio Hosono, Michiko Iizuka, "Chile's Salmon Industry: Policy Challenges in Managing Public Goods" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 4431557652 | 230 pages | PDF | 5 MB

This book is the first to analyze Chile’s salmon farming industry in discussing industrial development in terms of the management of public goods. The book highlights important aspects of learning and capacity development, environmental sustainability, institutions, and social welfare or inclusiveness. 

With aquaculture now providing almost half the global fish harvest, Chile’s salmon farming and processing industry stands out as a leader in the new “blue revolution”. Taking a holistic, historic approach to understanding the evolutionary development of the industry, the authors employ this strategy in the belief that policy discussions of economic activities have become highly segmented and often provide only a partial picture. Such segmentation 
is problematic for policy studies based on a complex web of interactions among numerous agents. The present volume untangles this web by considering the development of the Chilean salmon industry not only in holistic and historic terms but also from a socioeconomic point of view. 

The valuable book offers insightful lessons that can be applied to other natural resource-based sectors facing similar 
challenges in the course of development.

Katsuhisa Uchiyama, "Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis and Carbon Dioxide Emissions" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 4431559191 | 72 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This book investigates the relationship between environmental degradation and income, focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from around the world, to explore the possibility of sustainable development under global warming. Although many researchers have tackled this problem by estimating the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), unlike the approach to sulfur dioxide emissions, there seems to be little consensus about whether EKC is formed with regard to CO2 emissions. Thus, EKC is one of the most controversial issues in the field of environmental economics. This book contributes three points with academic rigor. First, an unbalanced panel dataset containing over 150 countries with the latest CO2 emission data between 1960 and 2010 is constructed. Second, based on this dataset, the CO2 emission–income relationship is analyzed using strict econometric methods such as the dynamic panel model. Third, as it is often pointed out that some factors other than income affect CO2 emission, several variables were added to the estimation model to examine the effects of changes of industrial structure, energy composition, and overseas trade on CO2 emission.

Roger Seaman, "Explorative Mediation at Work: The Importance of Dialogue for Mediation Practice" 
English | ISBN: 1137516720 | 2016 | 260 pages | PDF | 4 MB

Exploring and critiquing various methods of mediation, this innovative book critically develops a new explorative practice in the field. Considering ways in which mediators may influence disputing parties, especially in the workplace where mediators are paid to intervene, Explorative Mediation at Work questions the common claim that mediation is a neutral intervention. The difference between offering minimally intrusive support and acting to secure a containment and even suppression of workplace conflict is heavily dependent upon a mediator’s practices. At worst, engineering resolution may tarnish mediation’s reputation for impartiality. At best, mediation can win the trust of parties in conflict, facilitate a democratic engagement and be of real benefit to organizations. This book aims to demonstrate the latter in proposing a practice that supports parties to seek out dialogue from which relationships may be rebuilt and practical problems resolved.

Frequent reference is made to the importance of workplace diversity but the remarkable and specific benefits it can bring to organizations are often overlooked. Equally, reference is rarely made to the problems of introducing it into a workplace even though these may prevent it taking root in an organisation. These are major oversights which make it difficult for organizations to present the case for diversity and take steps to ensure its effective introduction.

Written by experts in the field this book fills these gaps by showing how national culture, gender and personality can impact on teamwork, management style, design and marketing preferences. It recommends a strategic approach to the implementation of diversity and offers solutions that can be delivered to match customer preferences. As well as discussing these specific benefits, the book alerts readers to the many obstacles that can impede its introduction.

English | ISBN: 0230358799, 1349347574 | 2012 | 280 pages | PDF | 5 MB

Social enterprises have been a growing phenomenon around the world in the past decade. The authors of this volume argue that they represent a unique type of organization. By combining social goals with a business orientation, both critical for their mission and survival, they represent a breed of organization with two kinds of logic that in the past were not perceived as belonging under the same organizational roof. The business logic, with its focus on competition and private ownership, did not seem a fitting context in which to deal with social issues or problems. These are traditionally dealt with by a service logic that emphasizes a charitable, empathetic orientation. Putting these two orientations together calls for creative organizational solutions, especially if these organizations are to be stable and sustainable. Social Enterprises presents a first attempt to do that. An organizational perspective of social enterprises allows us to analyze issues such as their governing structure, their modes of operation and their marketing strategies, and begins to formulate some theoretical constructs on how these entities can survive and thrive. This volume provides not only a theoretical and empirical basis to examine these issues, but an international perspective as well.

Professor Mary M. McKinley, "Ethics in Marketing and Communications: Towards a Global Perspective" 
English | ISBN: 0230358551, 1349347515 | 2012 | 144 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Research indicates that the integrity demonstrated by a business can have a positive effect on its bottom line. The challenge is to not only embrace and voice ethical principles, but to also practice them in all business transactions. When the world knows that a business can be trusted to act ethically, the results show up not only in higher profits but also in lower employee turnover and better customer relations. 

This volume of research reinforces our comprehension of marketing as more than a functional area of organisations; marketing spans the boundaries of the enterprise and is the nexus for many of its stakeholders. Therefore, the reader will find chapters relating not only to typical marketing activities such as advertising but also about the importance of communicating ethics in the banking industry and the ethical concerns of promoting tourism. For it is not a matter of simply behaving ethically but of voicing that behavior and the resulting impact of it on the company, on the consumer, on the shareholder and on society as a whole.

Practitioners and educators will find useful insights that will permit them to understand the different and conflicting perspectives on ethical dilemmas in marketing and communications, to propose and defend the 'best' ethical response to the situation and to accept that there are consequences for each of those involved in the decision. Ethical dilemmas are often multifold, requiring the individual to explore, differentiate and choose among conflicting loyalties. 

The countries that provide the setting for the research in this book include China, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Elizabeth Hodges Snyder, Kristen McIvor, "Sowing Seeds in the City: Human Dimensions" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 9401774544 | 405 pages | PDF | 20 MB

A majority of the world’s population lives in cities. Urban areas have largely been disconnected from the processes associated with producing food. A broad range of community efforts have emerged to reconnect people in urban areas to fresh foods with expected benefits for public health. These efforts can be found in cities across the country and cross both economic and ethnic lines. They have been led by the non- scientific community and are best characterized as social movements. Expansion of agriculture to non- traditional areas including community or kitchen gardens in urban or peri- urban environments has the potential to provide a range of ecosystem services as well as reduce stressors on non- urban environments. These services/benefits include improved public health, improved human nutrition and diet, large-scale production of renewable resources, increased food security with less resilience on traditional agricultural landscapes and seascapes, enhanced ecosystem function in urban areas, and increased public appreciation for and understanding of ecosystem services.

Simon Bridge, "Rethinking Enterprise Policy: Can Failure Trigger New Understanding?" 
English | ISBN: 0230235581, 134931398X | 2010 | 242 pages | PDF | 1 MB

In many countries, policies to increase levels of enterprise and entrepreneurship have been pursued for up to 30 years, but now there is evidence to suggest that they do not work. These failures need to be addressed and this book provides answers to the many questions that have resulted from this failure.

Simon Bridge considers the models of enterprise that have supported policy and examines some of the thinking behind them. He suggests a categorisation of entrepreneurship to try to introduce some clarity to a sometimes confusing debate about its meaning and an interpretation of social capital to try to explain its relevance. Finally he brings such considerations together to derive an alternative model of enterprise which is consistent with the evidence and which might therefore lead to better policy.

Anders Ogren, "The Swedish Financial Revolution" 
English | ISBN: 0230234046, 134958892X | 2010 | 248 pages | PDF | 2 MB

How could Sweden go from a financially backward country to one with a well-functioning financial system? Why did this financial revolution occur after the mid-nineteenth century and not before? What was the role of politics and what was the role of economics in this change? What did this financial revolution mean for the economic development, market integration and financial crises? These are some of the issues explored in this book. 

Today the existence of a financial system might be taken for granted in all economically developed countries. It is hard to imagine society without one. Despite financial setbacks and problems, as today during the financial crisis, there is no doubt that a well-functioning financial system promotes economic wealth. However, in Sweden finance was, for a long time and until recently, a matter that concerned only a few people. During a short period of time from the 1850s to the 1870s many institutional and organizational changes spurred a rapidly increasing financial deepening that took off in the late 1860s. But as finance becomes a matter for the general public, so do financial crises. This books tells us why and how this financial revolution took place and how it affected not only all sectors of the economy but also politics

Understanding the Caribbean Enterprise: Insights from MSMEs and Family Owned Businesses by Lawrence A. Nicholson and Jonathan G. Lashley
English | 2016 | ISBN: 1349948780 | 139 pages | PDF | 2,2 MB

This engaging book fills a substantial gap in the understanding of Caribbean enterprises, focusing upon FOBs (family-owned businesses) about which, despite accounting for 70% of private sector employment in the region, very little is known. Concentrating on MSMEs which represent the majority of FOBs in the English-speaking Caribbean, the authors compare and contrast their experiences to those in developed countries, focusing in particular on areas such as family business succession, business financing and marketing. Understanding the Caribbean Enterprise provides context-specific lessons from a historical perspective of business and entrepreneurship, which in turn provide an understanding of the current issues facing MSMEs and FOBs in the English-speaking Caribbean.

2016 | ISBN-10: 9811005982 | 255 pages | PDF | 3 MB

This book focuses on India’s participation in the WTO dispute settlement system, at a time when India has emerged as one of the most successful and prominent users of WTO dispute settlement among the developing countries. It offers a unique collection of perspectives from insiders – legal practitioners, policymakers, industry representatives and academics – on India’s participation in the system since its creation in 1995. Presenting in-depth analyses of substantive issues, the book shares rare insights into the jurisprudential significance, political economy contexts and capacity-building challenges faced by India. It closely examines India’s approach in effectively participating in the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism including the framing of litigation strategies, developing legal and stakeholder infrastructure, implementing dispute settlement decisions, and the impacts of the findings of the WTO panels / Appellate Body on domestic policymaking and India’s long-term trade interests. In addition to discussing the key “classic” jurisprudential issues, the book also explores domestic regulatory and policy issues, complemented by selected case studies.

Whatever happened to the money supply? This book explains how the analysis of monetary and credit aggregates is undertaken at the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and (as an example of a developing country) the Bank of Tanzania. The book also explores how this analysis relates to these central banks' monetary policy strategies and how it feeds into policymaking. An editorial introduction provides the intellectual and historical background – from the contributions of key economists such as Milton Friedman and Jacques Polak, to monetary targeting and inflation targeting – and argues that central banks and policy analysts would be foolish to neglect the insights monetary analysis can offer. The papers compiled in Monetary Analysis at Central Banks demonstrate just how useful and varied those insights are.

http://nitroflare.com/view/E66648AF7D1925C/1137576383.pdf
https://filejoker.net/0o9metgo65uy


David Lansky, "Family Wealth Continuity: Building a Foundation for the Future" 
English | ISBN: 1137576383 | 2016 | 156 pages | PDF | 5 MB

Most family business owners and wealth creators share an important vision: perpetuating family and wealth for many generations to come. To ensure wealth continuity, many families put into place various structures, plans, and processes, including estate plans (which may include multiple trusts), ownership succession plans, governance structures/strategies, and others. These sometimes-elaborate plans are aimed at preserving family wealth. In reality, for many families, they don’t. In fact, it has been estimated that a majority of estate plans in place fail, largely as a result of family conflict or communication problems. Author David Lansky reveals here that too many one-size-fits-all and elaborate continuity plans fail to take into account the idiosyncratic family factors that can interfere with continuity planning. Lansky details further how building the right foundation will help families implement the best continuity plans. Addressing that foundation effectively includes understanding the building blocks that make it up, assessing their strengths, and developing strategies to improve them. The specific building blocks include:
•	Learning Capacity 
•	Familyness 
•	Safe Communication Culture 
•	Commitment to Personal Development
•	Effective Leadership of Change

While richly informative, this book is not intended as a training manual, but rather as a starting point for important ideas and conversations. In fact, the goal of this book is to help families consider several related factors that go into a foundation for continuity, and to build more effective continuity plans and strategies based on their assessments.

Sami Mahroum, "Black Swan Start-ups: Understanding the Rise of Successful Technology Business in Unlikely Places" 
English | ISBN: 1137577266 | 2016 | 254 pages | PDF | 6 MB

This book explores startups that have thrived against the odds in places where startup success was deemed to be unlikely. Discussing a number of technology startups from around the world that have succeeded without state backing nor local venture and seed capital, Black Swan Start Ups provides unique insights into unsung models of success beyond the two dominant narratives of Asia’s ‘Tiger Economies’ and America’s Silicon Valley miracle. The author describes these stories of success as ‘black swan events’ and ascribes their achievements to the ability of entrepreneurs to leverage the ‘place surplus’ of their locations, while building connections to support networks outside their immediate geographies. Including case studies such as Skype in Estonia, SoundCloud in Germany and Bayt.Com in Dubai, this insightful book gives a holistic and wide-ranging view of how technology startups have, and can, succeed in less likely places.

Gerald G. Grant, "The Value Imperative: Harvesting Value from Your IT Initiatives" 
English | ISBN: 1137590394 | 2016 | 207 pages | PDF | 7 MB

Organizational executives must change the way they think about how to invest in and manage IT if they want to get lasting value from computer-based innovations. The old way of thinking has not served organizations well. They continue to experience high levels of technological and operational failures even though they apply a wide variety of industry best practices. The rapid pace of technological advancement has tended to hide some fundamental problems that have existed from the start. These involve, not the technology only, but also the management and application of that technology. The human and organizational factors have not kept pace. They have remained relatively static and, to a shocking degree, ineffective.

As a result, the IT department in many organizations has remained a breed apart. Communication between IT and the rest of the organization is fraught with misunderstanding. This leads to failures, recrimination, and, sometimes, wholesale changes which fall well short of their goals. The authors wrote this book because they wanted to help both business and IT to shift their focus from technology project implementation to that of value realization. 

In The Value Imperative readers will be introduced to a new business model called The Agricultural Model created by the authors for managing IT in organizations. This innovative model will help you learn how to change the mindset of people in your organization about how IT should be invested in and managed; key considerations for ensuring that business value is delivered from IT investments; how to measure that value that has been delivered and whether there has been effective return on the investments made; and finally the authors challenge business and IT managers to focus on the business value that customers seek which will help companies.

International development is a dynamic, vibrant and complex field – both in terms of practices and in relation to framing and concepts. This collection draws together leading experts from a range of disciplines, including development economics, geography, sociology, political science and international relations, to explore persistent problems and emergent trends in international development. Building from an introduction to key development theories, this Handbook proceeds to examine key development questions relating to the changing donor and aid landscape, the changing role of citizens and the state in development, the role of new finance flows and privatization in development, the challenges and opportunities of migration and mobility, emerging issues of insecurity and concerns with people trafficking, the drugs trade and gang violence, the role of rights and activism in promoting democracy and development, the threats posed by and responses to global environmental change, and the role of technology and innovation in promoting development.

Christian Karner, "The Commonalities of Global Crises: Markets, Communities and Nostalgia" 
English | ISBN: 1137502711 | 2016 | 371 pages | PDF | 6 MB

Bringing together contributions from an international group of social scientists, this collection examines diverse crises, both historical and contemporary, which implicate market forces, widening inequalities, social exclusion, forms of resistance, and ideological polarisation. The Commonalities of Global Crises offers carefully researched case studies which stretch across large geographical distances- from Egypt to the US and from northern, central, eastern and southern Europe to South America- and covers timely issues including human rights, slavery, care, migration, racism, and the far right. The volume demonstrates that such different settings and diverse concerns are characterized by a common tension in which the crises that unfold around pressures of widening marketization and commodification are met by the (re)building or re-assertion of various communities, and competing politics of solidarity and nostalgia.

Federico Beltrame, "Valuing Banks: A New Corporate Finance Approach" 
English | ISBN: 1137561416 | 2016 | 242 pages | PDF | 5 MB

This book aims to overcome the limitations the variations in bank-specifics impose by providing a bank-specific valuation theoretical framework and a new asset-side model. The book includes also a constructive comparison of equity and asset side methods. The authors present a novel framework entitled, the “Asset Mark-down Model”. This method incorporates an Adjusted Present Value model, which allows practitioners to identify the main value creation sources of a particular bank: from asset-based cash flow and the mark-down on deposits, to tax benefits on bearing liabilities. Through the implementation of this framework, the authors offer a more accurate and more specific approach to valuing banks.

Sam Polk, "For the Love of Money: A Memoir"
English | ISBN: 1476785988 | 2016 | 288 pages | EPUB, MOBI, AZW3 | 2 MB

In 2014, a former hedge fund trader’s New York Times Sunday Review front page article about wealth addiction instantly went viral. This is his unflinching memoir about coming of age on Wall Street, fighting to overcome the ghosts of his past and the radical new way he now defines success.
At just thirty years old, Sam Polk was a senior trader for one of the biggest hedge funds on Wall Street, on the verge of making it to the very top. When he was offered an annual bonus of $3.75 million, he grew angry because it was not enough. In that moment he knew he had lost himself in his obsessive pursuit of money. And he had come to loathe the culture, the shallowness, the sexism, the crude machismo and Wall Street’s use of wealth as the sole measure of a person’s worth. He decided to walk away from it all.
For Polk, becoming a Wall Street trader was the fulfilment of his dreams. But in reality it was just the culmination of a life of addictive and self-destructive behaviours, from overeating, to bulimia, to alcohol and drug abuse. His obsessive pursuit of money papered over years of insecurity and emotional abuse. Making money was just the latest attempt to fill the void left by his narcissist and emotionally unavailable father.
As in Liar’s Poker, Polk brings readers into the rarefied world of Wall Street trading floors, capturing the modern frustrations of young graduates drawn to Wall Street. Raw, vivid, and immensely readable, For the Love of Money explores the birth of a young hedge fund trader, his disillusionment, and the radical new way he has come to define success.

English | 2016 | ISBN: 1137583142, 1137583150 | 187 pages | PDF | 2,2 MB

Shakespeare is a cultural phenomenon and arguably the most renowned playwright in history.

From the marketing of Shakespeare’s plays on and off stage, to the wider impact of Shakespeare in fields such as education, and the commercial use of Shakespeare as a brand in the advertising and tourist industries, this volume makes an important contribution to our understanding of the Shakespeare industry 400 years after his death.

With a foreword from the celebrated cultural economist Bruno Frey and nine essays exploring the cultural and economic impact of Shakespeare in his own day and the present, Shakespeare’s Cultural Capital forms a unique offering to the study of cultural economics and Shakespeare.

Maintaining Effective Engineering Leadership: A New Dependence on Effective Process (Management of Technology) By Raymond Morrison
2013 | 282 Pages | ISBN: 1849196893 | PDF | 11 MB


Maintaining Effective Engineering Leadership explores process as a means of maintaining leadership development. The author argues that engineering leadership is the result of the development of four fundamental concepts: personal managerial skills, self-leadership skills, operational leadership skills, and organizational leadership skills. Each is explored in turn, and examples are taken from the space shuttle Columbia disaster to show the importance of these processes and skills, and what can happen when they are ignored. The book introduces the Capability Maturity Model which provides organizations with appropriate processes and knowledge guidelines to ensure effective leadership to avoid such disasters. Topics covered include: a good process gone bad – setting the stage with the Columbia disaster, the importance of process, leadership is guiding a process-oriented organization, maintaining vigilance for product and the need for change, the financial impact on process and operations, how do we change – what do we need to do?, individual capability, recommendations for process and capability in today’s industries. This book is essential reading for engineers with a management focus (and vice versa) and will find a place on the bookshelves of engineers to use in the continuing development of their personal leadership skills.

Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground By Susan M. Opp
2013 | 346 Pages | ISBN: 1439880085 | PDF | 7 MB


A clear and practical examination of complex issues, Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground provides a broad, academic look at the intersection of two important areas for local administrators. In addition to managing development in a strained economic climate, most administrators are also expected to be stewards of the environment. However, economic conditions often leave them with limited options for pursuing economic development and, at the same time, being environmentally mindful. Many find themselves without a clear understanding of the concepts, tools, and best practices available to accomplish this herculean task. Translating complex environmental and economic concepts into easily applicable practices, the book: Gives practitioners the information they need to communicate with consultants, constituents, and officials, and to avoid ideological obstacles Compares regulatory differences between states and other geographical differences Includes examples from across the country to highlight variations in environmental regulations and laws Provides technical, legal, and political insights into the process of pursuing local economic development projects that incorporate protection and awareness Contains case studies that demonstrate the concepts in action, allowing readers to fully grasp the complexities associated with sustainable economic development Discusses how local administrators can balance the economic and environmental needs of the future Bridging the gap between policy-making intention and outcome, this book connects readers with a larger body of research that not only underpins practical applications but also helps them avoid legal, technical, and political obstacles. It provides an arsenal of best practices and everyday, easy-to-use strategies for optimizing the difficult balance between economic development and environmental protection.

This book investigates the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes on macroeconomic instability and economic growth in recipient countries. Employing the New Institutional Economics approach as an analytical framework, it identifies the determinants of economic and political institutional quality by taking into account a broad variety of indicators such as parliamentary forms of government, the aggregate governance level, civil and economic liberties, property rights etc. The book subsequently estimates the impact of these institutional determinants on real economic growth, both directly and also indirectly, through the channel of macroeconomic instability, in recipient countries. Moreover, it illustrates the effectiveness of IMF programmes in the case of Pakistan, a frequent user of IMF resources.

Why are so many researchers, politicians, and practitioners thinking and writing about resilience today? Social scientists have started only recently to deal with social resilience in various spheres. Since not long ago, resilience was strongly connected with the question of what makes individuals or ecosystems to overcome threats like disruption, catastrophes, external shocks etc. Thus, a new research perspective on resilience is offered.

http://nitroflare.com/view/F3F905B073DD1EE/3319404865.pdf


The Public Economy in Crisis: Why We Need an Economics of Popular Sovereignty (SpringerBriefs in Economics) by June Sekera
2016 | ISBN: 3319404865 | English | 95 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This Brief proposes a new theory of public economics which deemphasizes reliance on the free market and affirms the importance of public goods and services within the context of the democratic process and constitutional governance. Public non-market production makes up from a quarter to more than half of all economic activity in advanced democratic nation-states. Yet by imposing market precepts on the public domain, as mainstream economics, political science, and public administration do, public governing capacity is weakened and the democratic system suffers. Agencies originally created to meet public needs are being warped into entities whose purpose is to generate revenue and, in some cases, deliver private profits at public expense. Drawing on classic public finance literature, this book illustrates the differences between public economy and the market model and why those differences matter. Building on this, the Brief sketches the elements of a new theory of the public non-market and illuminates its connections to the delegation of power and collective provision of resources from the polity. This book will be useful to scholars of public economics, political science, and public administration as well as policy makers and those working in the public sector.

This book is the sixth volume in a series entitled “Contemporary Logistics in China,” authored by researchers at the Logistics Center, Nankai University. In the spirit of the five preceding volumes, published annually in previous years, this book carries on the ideal of providing a systematic exposition on the development of logistics in China to the English-speaking community. Specifically, this volume captures China’s logistics development at a crucial turning point.

Subjects covered include the macro-factors pertaining to logistics development, region-specific plans, industry-wide transformation, globally oriented moves, and current hot topics. Expositions and analyses on these subjects are based on the latest available sources and statistical data. As with the previous volumes, the ultimate aim of this book is to present a timely portrait of the rapid growth of China’s logistics market and the status of its logistics industry’s evolution. In so doing, this book offers an in-depth analysis of the critical issues and dilemmas amid the ongoing, dynamic and multi-faceted development, and presents a valuable reference source for interested readers in the academic and professional fields.

German | 21 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 3658126574 | 108 Pages | PDF (True) | 1.57 MB

Dieses Fachbuch analysiert die Probleme, Risiken und Anreize des PEPP-Systems (Version 2015) anhand der Behandlung der Alkoholabhängigkeit. Dafür wurden über 1.300 Fälle des Evangelischen Krankenhauses Bielefeld aus dem Jahr 2014 verwendet. Zunächst wurden Fallgruppen erstellt für die Gruppen dann Parameter wie Verweildauer (VWD), PEPP-Kodierung, Erlöseinbußen durch Fallzusammenführungen und Fallerlöse ausgewertet. Ergänzend zu diesen Daten wurden Veränderungen der VWD, der Kodierung und zusätzliche Verlegungen zwischen G-DRG- und PEPP-System simuliert. So konnten Anreize zur Verkürzung der VWD bei paralleler Fallzahlsteigerung nachgewiesen werden. Patienten mit einem hohen pflegerischen Betreuungsaufwand sind „unlukrativ“, während stationäre psychotherapeutische Behandlungen positive Deckungsbeiträge ermöglichen. Komplizierte Fälle werden benachteiligt. Daneben konnten Anreize zur gezielten Verlegung zwischen G-DRG- und PEPP-System dargestellt werden.

Haruhito Takeda, "Micro-Performance During Postwar Japan's High-Growth Era" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 981100708X | 174 pages | PDF | 2 MB

The aim of this book is to analyze Japan's high-growth economy, in particular to clarify the kinds of changes in people’s lives that were generated by high growth. The present volume focuses not on the macro-economic mechanisms that expanded the scale of the economy, but on the micro-economic changes that were effected in everyday life. The emergence of a mass consumption society as a result of economic growth suggests that people's lifestyles and consumer behavior changed in various ways. 

The first chapter focuses on the apparel industry's expanding market as it corresponded to changes in consumer behavior. Even as consumer life became more comfortable and abundant, consumers were becoming uneasy about the environmental deterioration associated with high growth. The second chapter examines how the Japanese government addressed emissions regulations while drawing on the lessons of America's experience with the same issue.

The change in industrial structure brought about by economic growth inevitably resulted in the decline of other industries. Chief among these was the coal-mining industry, which, with the onset of a full-scale energy revolution, lost its role as energy supplier owing to the import of cheap crude oil. The third chapter discusses the government's industrial policies as they addressed the coal industry's adjustment in the high-growth era, concluding that they reduced such problems as stagnation, unemployment, and local industrial decline. The adjustments in employment practices contributed positively to the gradual shift of labor from declining industries to growth industries. The fourth chapter investigates changes in labor management in the steel industry, which was one of the high-growth era's leading industries. This publication will serve as a valuable resource for those who are interested not only in the post-war history in Japan but also in high growth economies in recent East Asia.

226 <--> Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream

Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream by Andy Stern
2016 | ISBN: 1610396251 | English | 272 pages | EPUB/AZW3 | 0.7 MB/1 MB

Advances in technology are creating the next economy and enabling us to make things/do things/connect with others in smarter, cheaper, faster, more effective ways. But the price of this progress has been a decoupling of the engine of prosperity from jobs that have been the means by which people have ascended to (and stayed in) the middle class.

Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) spent four years traveling the country and asking economists, futurists, labor leaders, CEOs, investment bankers, entrepreneurs, and political leaders to help picture the U.S. economy 25 to 30 years from now. He vividly reports on people who are analyzing and creating this new economysuch as investment banker Steve Berkenfeld; David Cote, the CEO of Honeywell International; Andy Grove of Intel; Carl Camden, the CEO of Kelly Services; and Geoffrey Canada of the Harlem Children’s Zone. Through these stories, we come to a stark and deeper understanding of the toll technological progress will continue to take on jobs and income and its inevitable effect on tens of millions of people.

But there is hope for our economy and future. The foundation of economic prosperity for all Americans, Stern believes, is a universal basic income. The idea of a universal basic income for all Americans is controversial but American attitudes are shifting. Stern has been a game changer throughout his career, and his next goal is to create a movement that will force the political establishment to take action against something that many on both the right and the left believe is inevitable. Stern’s plan is bold, idealistic, and challengingand its time has come.

Saumitra N. Bhaduri , Ekta Selarka, "Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility of Indian Companies" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 9811009244 | 152 pages | PDF | 3 MB

The book explores the theoretical and empirical issues relating to the interaction between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities undertaken by Indian companies. It presents a highly detailed view on the evolution of CSR and its nexus with corporate governance. This is particularly timely in the context of the recent Indian Companies Act 2013, which mandates corporate social responsibility and revises the best corporate-governance practices for large companies.

The findings of this study are unique in drawing from a unified framework of Indian corporate governance structure and corporate engagement in CSR. The book’s scope is both academic and practical; the research methodology developed and utilized is useful for researchers, while the implications and the selection of variables provide useful information for practitioners and stakeholders. Finally, although it focuses on large Indian companies, the findings can also be applied to research on other emerging economies.

Ray Fisman, Tim Sullivan, "The Inner Lives of Markets: How People Shape Them—And They Shape Us"
ISBN: 1610394925 | 2016 | EPUB/AZW | 224 pages | 642 KB/759 KB

America’s economic revolution isn’t just driven by technology. It’s about markets.

The past twenty-five years have witnessed a remarkable shift in how we get the stuff we want. If you’ve ever owned a business, rented an apartment, or shopped online, you’ve had a front-row seat for this revolution-in-progress. Breakthrough companies like Amazon and Uber have disrupted the old ways and made the economy work better—all thanks to technology.
At least that’s how the story of the modern economy is usually told. But in this lucid, wry book, Ray Fisman and Tim Sullivan show that the revolution is bigger than tech: it is really a story about the transformation of markets. From the auction theories that power Google’s ad sales algorithms to the models that online retailers use to prevent internet fraud, even the most high-tech modern businesses are empowered by theory first envisioned by economists.
And we’re all participants in this revolution. Every time you book a room on Airbnb, hire a car on Lyft, or click on an ad, you too are reshaping our social institutions and our lives.

The Inner Lives of Markets is necessary reading for the modern world: it reveals the blueprint for how we work, live, and shop, and offers wisdom for how to do it better.

http://avxhome.in/blogs/viserion
http://nitroflare.com/view/A29E45B5182C5DF/0544303180_Dollars2Day.epub


Kathryn J. Edin, H. Luke Shaefer, "$2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America"
ISBN: 0544303180 | 2015 | EPUB | 240 pages | 2 MB

A revelatory account of poverty in America so deep that we, as a country, don’t think it exists

Jessica Compton’s family of four would have no cash income unless she donated plasma twice a week at her local donation center in Tennessee. Modonna Harris and her teenage daughter Brianna in Chicago often have no food but spoiled milk on weekends. 

After two decades of brilliant research on American poverty, Kathryn Edin noticed something she hadn’t seen since the mid-1990s — households surviving on virtually no income. Edin teamed with Luke Shaefer, an expert on calculating incomes of the poor, to discover that the number of American families living on $2.00 per person, per day, has skyrocketed to 1.5 million American households, including about 3 million children.

Where do these families live? How did they get so desperately poor? Edin has “turned sociology upside down” (Mother Jones) with her procurement of rich — and truthful — interviews. Through the book’s many compelling profiles, moving and startling answers emerge. 

The authors illuminate a troubling trend: a low-wage labor market that increasingly fails to deliver a living wage, and a growing but hidden landscape of survival strategies among America’s extreme poor. More than a powerful exposé, $2.00 a Day delivers new evidence and new ideas to our national debate on income inequality.

https://filejoker.net/l33j3xv4yp1o


Environmentally Responsible Supply Chains By Atalay Atasu
2016 | 388 Pages | ISBN: 331930092X | PDF | 6 MB


This book highlights what it takes to be successful in identifying and executing environmental responsibility from an operational perspective. It provides cutting-edge research from globally recognized field experts. It is a useful resource for practitioners to explore why and how firms engage in environmentally responsible operations, but also a valuable resource for academics as an introductory reference that provides direct exposure to key environmental operational problems faced by many firms today. This book can also be used as an introductory reading for students with varying educational backgrounds - from business school students interested in environmental issues to environmental scientists interested in obtaining a business perspective - as it provides a broad scope of key issues at the interface of operations management and environmental and social responsibility. Environmentally Responsible Supply Chains is structured in a modular fashion, with each chapter introducing and analyzing a specific timely topic, allowing readers to identify the chapters that relate to their interests. More specifically, the book distinguishes between two key drivers of environmentally responsibility: Profit and Regulatory compliance. The book is divided into five sections. The first three sections of the book explore profit driven environmental responsibility, and provide examples as to where the motives for environmentally responsible business practices come from, where business opportunities are, and what operational perspectives are key to profitability. The last two sections of the book focus on regulation as a driver of environmental responsibility and identify motives, opportunities, or operational perspectives as to effective regulatory compliance. Ultimately the book introduces the reader to the fundamentals of sustainable operations and highlights the latest research on the topic.

https://filejoker.net/by4v51y5kq70


Jovo Ateljević and Jelena Trivić, "Economic Development and Entrepreneurship in Transition Economies: Issues, Obstacles and Perspectives" 
English | ISBN: 3319288555 | 2016 | 320 pages | PDF | 5 MB

This book contributes to a better understanding of entrepreneurship in transition economies. Current literature reflects the more traditional schools of thought on entrepreneurship, which are influenced by the Western perspective, and fail to fully address the scenario in transition economies. There is a broad consensus among academics, policy makers, and practitioners that a fundamental cause of difficulties experienced by most economies in transition has been the fact that reform has not been accompanied by the creation of new, private businesses, and particularly SMEs. This is especially evident in states created in Europe after the dissolution of the Soviet Union where many barriers, which were inherited from the old system, remain in place, thus inhibiting entrepreneurial progress in these countries despite a favorable political and economic environment. The contributions featured in this book focus on how much progress has been achieved so far with regard to these aspects, as well as identify which current barriers and issues still need to be resolved. Themes include innovation performance, financing, venture capital, educational factors, and entrepreneurial learning.

Silk and Tea in the North: Scandinavian Trade and the Market for Asian Goods in Eighteenth-Century Europe (Europe's Asian Centuries) by Hanna Hodacs
2016 | ISBN: 1137455438 | English | 216 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This book links the trade of the Danish and Swedish East India companies to the British taste for tea, a Scandinavian craving for colourful Chinese silk textiles, import substitutions schemes and natural history in the eighteenth century. It is a global history exploring the exchange of silver for goods in Canton. It is also a European history studying the wholesale market for Asian goods in Gothenburg and Copenhagen, the formation of taste and the impact of fashion in the blending of tea and the assortments of colours on wrought silk destined for markets across Europe. Linking material history to political economy and the histories of science, this book ends on the threshold of the nineteenth century, the rise of the second British Empire in Asia, and the creation of synthetic dyes in Europe.

https://filejoker.net/vri02g6jbdg3


Leveraged Exchange-Traded Funds: Price Dynamics and Options Valuation By Tim Leung, Marco Santoli
2016 | 108 Pages | ISBN: 3319290924 | PDF | 3 MB


This book provides an analysis, under both discrete-time and continuous-time frameworks, on the price dynamics of leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs), with emphasis on the roles of leverage ratio, realized volatility, investment horizon, and tracking errors. This study provides new insights on the risks associated with LETFs. It also leads to the discussion of new risk management concepts, such as admissible leverage ratios and admissible risk horizon, as well as the mathematical and empirical analyses of several trading strategies, including static portfolios, pairs trading, and stop-loss strategies involving ETFs and LETFs. The final part of the book addresses the pricing of options written on LETFs. Since different LETFs are designed to track the same reference index, these funds and their associated options share very similar sources of randomness. The authors provide a no-arbitrage pricing approach that consistently value options on LETFs with different leverage ratios with stochastic volatility and jumps in the reference index. Their results are useful for market making of these options, and for identifying price discrepancies across the LETF options markets. As the market of leveraged exchange-traded products become a sizeable connected part of the financial market, it is crucial to better understand its feedback effect and broader market impact. This is important not only for individual and institutional investors, but also for regulators.

240 <--> Multiple Helix Ecosystems for Sustainable Competitiveness
http://nitroflare.com/view/FD9D2CDAA1C1858/3319296752_Multiple.pdf
https://filejoker.net/6c35u18g7giy


Multiple Helix Ecosystems for Sustainable Competitiveness By Marta Peris-Ortiz, João J. Ferreira, Luís Farinha
2016 | 200 Pages | ISBN: 3319296752 | PDF | 4 MB


This book discusses the main issues, challenges, opportunities, and trends involving the interactions between academia, industry, government and society. Specifically, it aims to explore how these interactions enhance the ways in which companies deliver products and services in order to achieve sustainable competitiveness in the marketplace. Sustainable competitiveness has been widely discussed by academics and practitioners, considering the importance of protecting the environment while sustaining the economic goals of organizations. The Quintuple Helix innovation model is a framework for facilitating knowledge, innovation and sustainable competitive advantage. It embeds the Triple and the Quadruple Helix models by adding a fifth helix, the “natural environment.” The Triple Helix model focuses on the university-industry-government triad, while the Quadruple adds civil society (the media- and culture-driven public) as a fourth helix. The Quintuple Helix model facilitates research, public policy, and practical application of sustainable competitiveness principles. Applying the most recent developments and theoretical insights of this model, the contributors to this volume address such questions as: how do government, academia, industry and civil society actors interact for promoting sustainable competitiveness at the country (regional) level? How do these actors influence sustainable operations management at the company (business) level? In so doing, they shed new light on the dynamics of economic growth, sustainability and competitiveness.

Understanding Leadership in Complex Systems: A Praxeological Perspective (Understanding Complex Systems) by Terje Andreas Tonsberg
English | 7 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 331940444X | 264 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.37 MB

This work proposes that Carl Menger’s Subjective Theory of Value (STV), and its subsequent elaboration by Ludwig von Mises as Praxeology, provides a useful alternative to more common methods in the study of action and social phenomena, and more specifically, to leadership in complex social systems. Rather than being based on rationality assumptions and algorithmic predictability, the STV emphasizes transient subjectivity shaped by a complex world of lacking information, mistakes, disequilibrium, uncertainty and attempted error correction that defy mathematization and exact prediction. As such, it is a framework to make sense of human action systems in terms of subjective understanding, learning, and uncertainty, rather than quantitative predictability. Accordingly, the aim of this work is to explain the STV as a general theory of action and to demonstrate its capability in developing adequate qualitative theory and to elaborate on some of the major topics that its implications raise with regard to leadership. The power of the method can be seen in that its procedure naturally branches out to facilitate an understanding of a broad selection of processes and may provide the basis for a universal theory of leadership.

The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels [Audiobook] by Alex Epstein
English | February 24, 2015 | ASIN: B00TRA7ZCK, ISBN: 1494560011, 1494510014 | MP3@128 kbps | 6 hrs 11 mins | 340 MB
Narrator: Alex Epstein | Genre: Nonfiction/Industries

For decades environmentalists have told us that using fossil fuels is a self-destructive addiction that will destroy our planet. Yet by every measure of human well-being, from life expectancy to clean water to climate safety, life has been getting better and better. How can this be?

The explanation is that we usually hear only one side of the story. We're taught to think only of the negatives of fossil fuels, their risks and side effects, but not their positives - their unique ability to provide cheap, reliable energy for a world of seven billion people. And the moral significance of cheap, reliable energy is woefully underrated. Energy is our ability to improve every single aspect of life, whether economic or environmental.

If we look at the big picture of fossil fuels compared with the alternatives, the overall impact of using fossil fuels is to make the world a far better place. We are morally obligated to use more fossil fuels for the sake of our economy and our environment.

2015 | ISBN: 1682190226 | English | 212 pages | PDF | 3 MB

The news is full of their names, supposedly the vanguard of a rethinking of capitalism. Lyft, Airbnb, Taskrabbit, Uber, and many more companies have a mandate of disruption and upending the "old order"-and they've succeeded in effecting the "biggest change in the American workforce in over a century," according to former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. But this new wave of technology companies is funded and steered by very old-school venture capitalists. And in What's Yours Is Mine, technologist Tom Slee argues the so-called sharing economy damages development, extends harsh free-market practices into previously protected areas of our lives, and presents the opportunity for a few people to make fortunes by damaging communities and pushing vulnerable individuals to take on unsustainable risk. Drawing on original empirical research, Slee shows that the friendly language of sharing, trust, and community masks a darker reality.

Maurizio Carta and Daniele Ronsivalle, "The Fluid City Paradigm: Waterfront Regeneration as an Urban Renewal Strategy" 
English | ISBN: 3319280031 | 2016 | 172 pages | PDF | 8 MB

This book presents a new paradigm of knowledge and action with respect to urban waterfronts and the “fluid city paradigm,” explaining its methodological framework and describing an integrated and creative planning approach in which waterfront regeneration is pursued as a key urban-renewal strategy. It focuses especially on the WATERFRONT project (“Water And Territorial policiEs for integRation oF multisectoRial develOpmeNT”), which was funded jointly by Italy and Malta with the goal of developing common guidelines, strategies, and operational tools for the planning of coastal areas, based on cross-border exchange of experiences. In the described approach, the waterfront is recognized as having a broad identity, acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between seaport and town and taking into account the physical and environmental components of human settlement, infrastructure, and productive and recreational activities. It highlights details of the process of renewal in the port city of Trapani, with discussion of the implemented actions, plans, and programs. The book also examines the practices adopted to transform city–port relationships across Europe in pursuit of innovative and sustainable development.

Bernardo Delogu, "Risk Analysis and Governance in EU Policy Making and Regulation: An Introductory Guide" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319308211 | 288 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This book provides an easy, but comprehensive and rigorous access to the main concepts, terminology, methods and procedures of risk analysis intended for all those involved in the EU policy and regulatory decision making on risks. It establishes a common ground of knowledge which enables a more informed dialogue on risks, a closer collaboration between decision makers and scientists and a better appraisal of the potential and limits of risk science. The book also brings together in an accessible way much multidisciplinary knowledge which had been dispersed over many technical documents and specialist books.

The EU is in the front line of health, safety and environmental risk management. GMOs, food safety, hazardous chemicals, climate change, radiation hazards, are just a few of the popular risk issues addressed by the EU through policy and regulatory measures. The risk analysis paradigm, including risk assessment, management and communication has been at the core of the EU decision making for a long time already. EU Institutions strive for a science-based approach to risk management. Nevertheless, the dialogue and collaboration on risk issues between policy makers, stakeholders and scientists are still difficult and the potential and limits of science in support of decision making, as well as the basic concepts of risk analysis are not fully understood outside the narrow specialist circles.

The Lost Bank: The Story of Washington Mutual - The Biggest Bank Failure in American History [Audiobook] by Kirsten Grind
English | June 28, 2012 | ASIN: B008FL3GTS, ISBN: 1470825643, 1470825635 | M4B@64 kbps | 14 hrs 11 mins | 385 MB
Narrator: Traber Burns | Genre: Nonfiction/Journalism

During the most dizzying days of the financial crisis, Washington Mutual, a bank with hundreds of billions of dollars in its coffers, suffered a crippling bank run. The story of its final, brutal collapse in the autumn of 2008, and its controversial sale to JPMorgan Chase, is an astonishing account of how one bank lost itself to greed and mismanagement, and how the entire financial industry - and even the entire country - lost its way as well.

Kirsten Grind's The Lost Bank is a magisterial and gripping account of these events, tracing the cultural shifts, the cockamamie financial engineering, and the hubris and avarice that made this incredible story possible. The men and women who become the central players in this tragedy - the regulators and the bankers, the home buyers and the lenders, the number crunchers and the shareholders - are heroes and villains, perpetrators and victims, often switching roles with one another as the drama unfolds.

Written as compellingly as the finest fiction, The Lost Bank makes it clear that the collapse of Washington Mutual was not just the largest bank failure in American history. It is a story of talismanic qualities, reflecting the incredible rise and the precipitous collapse of not only an institution, but of trust, fortunes, and the marketplaces for risk across the world.

Joseph E. Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo, Martin Guzman, "Too Little, Too Late: The Quest to Resolve Sovereign Debt Crises"
ISBN: 023117926X | 2016 | EPUB | 312 pages | 2 MB

The current approach to resolving sovereign debt crises does not work: sovereign debt restructurings come too late and do too little. Though they impose enormous costs on societies, these restructurings are often not deep enough to provide the conditions for economic recovery (as illustrated by the Greek debt restructuring of 2012. And if the debtor decides not to accept the terms demanded by the creditors, finalizing a restructuring can be slowed by legal challenges (as evidenced in Argentina).

A fresh start for distressed debtors is a basic principle of a well-functioning market economy, yet there is no international bankruptcy framework for sovereign debts. While this problem is not new, the United Nations and the global community are now willing to do something about it. Providing guidance for those who intend to take up reform, this book assesses the relative merits of various debt-restructuring proposals, especially in relation to the main deficiencies of the current nonsystem. With contributions by leading academics and practitioners, the volume reflects the overwhelming consensus among specialists on the need to find workable solutions.

European Yearbook of International Economic Law 2016
Springer | Law | August 17, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319292145 | 838 pages | pdf | 9.52 mb

Editors: Bungenberg, M., Herrmann, C., Krajewski, M., Terhechte, J.P. (Eds.)
Comprehensive collection of critical essays addressing all contested aspects of international economic law
Additional comments “criticising the critics”
Insights on recent regional developments such as TTIP, TPP and TiSA

Volume 7 of the EYIEL focusses on critical perspectives of international economic law. Recent protests against free trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) remind us that international economic law has always been a politically and legally contested field. This volume collects critical contributions on trade, investment, financial and other subfields of international economic law from scholars who have shaped this debate for many years. The critical contributions to this volume are challenged and sometimes rejected by commentators who have been invited to be “critical with the critics”. The result is a unique collection of critical essays accompanied by alternative and competing views on some of the most fundamental topics of international economic law.
In its section on regional developments, EYIEL 7 addresses recent megaregional and plurilateral trade and investment agreements and negotiations. Short insights on various aspects of the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) and its sister TTIP are complemented with comments on other developments, including the African Tripartite FTA und the negotiations on a plurilateral Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). Further sections address recent WTO and investment case law as well as recent developments concerning the IMF, UNCTAD and the WCO. The volume closes with reviews of recent books in international economic law.

Social Games and Identity in the Higher Education Workplace: Playing with Gender, Class and Emotion
Palgrave Macmillan UK | Sociology of Work | August 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137518022 | 222 pages | pdf | 2.16 mb

Authors: Addison, Michelle

We all play games at work – but have you ever wondered how your identity becomes bound up with game playing? This book is about employees in the Higher Education workplace and it provides an interpretation of why people act the way they do at work as an expression of game playing. It offers an insight into how people try to adapt and fit in at work by looking at how value is attached to certain identities through the lens of class and gender. The figure of the 'chav', the 'emotional woman', 'The Grafter', and 'Mrs. Bucket', are explored in detail as representations of what kinds of people are permitted, or not, to fit in at work. These identities are topical, and may even be familiar to readers, but the author’s analysis of them challenges why they exist, what function these identities serve at work, and who is able to deploy and inscribe them as part of the games people play at work.

Migration, Masculinities and Reproductive Labour: Men of the Home
Palgrave MacMillan | Migration | August 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137379774 | 301 pages | pdf | 4.9 mb

Authors: Gallo, Ester, Scrinzi, Francesca
Migration, Diasporas and Citizenship

This innovative book analyses the role gender plays in the relationship between globalisation, migration and reproductive labour. Exploring the gendered experiences of migrant men and the social construction of racialised masculinities in the context of the 'international division of reproductive labour' (IDRL), it examines how new patterns of consumption and provision of paid domestic/care work lead to forms of inequality across racial, ethnic, gender and class lines. Based on an ethnographic analysis of the working and family lives of migrant men within the IDRL, it focuses on the practices and strategies of migrant men employed as domestic/care workers in Italy. The authors highlight how migrant men's experiences of reproductive labour and family are shaped by global forces and national public policies, and how they negotiate the changes and potential conflicts that their 'feminised' jobs entail. They draw on the voices of men and women of different nationalities to show how masculinities are constructed within the home through migrant men's interactions with male and female employers, women relations and their wider ethnic network. Bridging the divide between scholarship on international migration, care work and masculinity studies, this book will interest sociologists, anthropologists, economists, political scientists and social policy experts.

Aldo Leopold's Odyssey, Tenth Anniversary Edition: Rediscovering the Author of A Sand County Almanac
Island Press | Ecology | May 24 2016 | ISBN-10: 1610917537 | 528 pages | pdf | 20.02 mb

Authors: Julianne Lutz Warren

In 2006, Julianne Lutz Warren&;(née&#160;Newton) asked readers to rediscover one of history’s most renowned conservationists. Aldo Leopold’s Odyssey was hailed by The New York Times as a “biography of ideas,” making “us feel the loss of what might have followed A Sand County Almanac by showing us in authoritative detail what led up to it.” Warren’s astute narrative quickly became an essential part of the Leopold canon, introducing new readers to the father of wildlife ecology and offering a fresh perspective to even the most seasoned scholars.
A decade later, as our very concept of wilderness is changing, Warren frames Leopold’s work in the context of the Anthropocene. With a new preface and foreword by Bill McKibben, the book underscores the ever-growing importance of Leopold’s ideas in an increasingly human-dominated landscape.
Drawing on unpublished archives, Warren traces Leopold’s quest to define and preserve land health. Leopold&#39;s journey took him from Iowa to Yale to the Southwest to Wisconsin, with fascinating stops along the way to probe the causes of early land settlement failures, contribute to the emerging science of ecology, and craft a new vision for land use.
Leopold’s life was dedicated to one fundamental dilemma: how can people live prosperously on the land and keep it healthy, too? For anyone compelled by this question, the Tenth Anniversary Edition of Aldo Leopold’s Odyssey offers insight and inspiration.

Springer | Asian Economics | August 10, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137597798 | 295 pages | pdf | 6.65 mb

Editors: Sato, Yukihito, Sato, Hajime (Eds.)

This book sheds new light on the advancement of various industries in developing Asian countries through an application and re-examination of catch-up industrialization theory. With contributors presenting their own perspectives on the progression of a range of different industries in Asia, this volume provokes readers to reconsider their current understanding of industrialization in latecomer countries. More specifically, the chapters discuss Taiwan's semiconductor industry, Korea's steel industry, and Malaysia's palm oil industry, amongst others. The authors also explore the 'catch-down' innovation strategy in China and India. Varieties and Alternatives of Catching-up provides a thorough analysis of the strategies employed by numerous Asian countries to radically transform their low-income agricultural economies to middle-income industrialized ones. This book is essential reading for researchers and scholars interested in Asian economic development.

Spotlight on China: Changes in Education under China's Market Economy by Shibao Guo
English | 1 Jan. 2016 | ISBN: 9462098794, 9462098808 | 410 Pages | PDF (True) | 5 MB

Fuelled by forces of globalization, China has gradually shifted from a centrally planned economy to a socialist market economy. Under the market economy China has experienced a massive and protracted economic boom. It is not clear however whether recent economic changes have brought the same miracle to education in China. Spotlight on China brings together established and emerging scholars from China and internationally in a dialogue about the profound social and economic transformation that has resulted from the market economy and its concomitant impact on education in China. The book covers a wide range of topics, including: • Market economy and curriculum reform • Teaching under China's market economy • Changes in higher education • Transitions from education to work • Market economy and social inequality With its broad scope and fresh critical perspectives, this collection offers a most contemporary and comprehensive analysis of possibly the largest education system in the world. Lessons learned from the China experiment will inform researchers and educators about social and educational reforms in other countries which are undergoing similar fundamental changes. "Spotlight on China provides a state of the art picture: dynamic, partial, full of contradictions and tensions, and, as we speak, in movement and local reconfiguration." - Allan Luke, Queensland University of Technology "The book moves social science research on China's education another step forward by refining the balance between the viability of mainstream western concepts and the analytical possibilities of creating a new scholarship based on a deeper understanding of the historically grounded realities of contemporary Chinese education." - Gerard A. Postiglione, The University of Hong Kong

Sustainable Consumption: Design, Innovation and Practice By Audley Genus
2016 | 188 Pages | ISBN: 3319296639 | PDF | 2 MB


This book originates from the work of contributors to initiatives and global networks promoting and pursuing lines of enquiry that recognise and probe relationships between sustainable consumption, design and production, and the implications of those relationships for new economic activity and the way we live and govern ourselves. It features contributions from social scientists (e.g. from the fields of innovation studies, geography, environmental policy and sociology) and practitioners, serving to generate a short-list of research perspectives and topics around which future research and actions in practice will be orientated. The book consists of ten chapters divided into three parts, focusing on: perspectives/methodological insights; empirical work integrating consumption and production; and site-specific practitioner-oriented case studies. The conclusion examines the key aspects of policy, research and practical implications.

Comment tremble la main invisible: Incertitude et marchés
French | 2009 | ISBN: 2287996648 | PDF | 214 pages | 4.2 MB

La crise amorcée en 2007 a révélé une faille des systèmes de gestion des risques financiers et une démesure des interventions spéculatives. L’originalité de ce livre est de proposer une approche des marchés fondée sur la distinction entre la modélisation de l’incertitude des phénomènes économiques et la forme des réponses que lui opposent les agents.

Audit comptable Audit informatique
French | 2004 | ISBN: 2804146340 | PDF | 300 pages | 8 MB

Le risque majeur encouru par les systèmes comptables informatisés réside non pas dans leur piratage, comme on pourrait l'imaginer, mais dans leur conception viciée ou dans leur mauvaise utilisation. Tel est l'objet traité par Audit comptable, Audit informatique dont voici la 3e édition complètement remaniée et mise à jour. Trois questions fondamentales régissent en fait l'audit comptable et informatique. La comptabilité étudiée est-elle légale : respecte-t-elle les règles comptables et fiscales légales ? Sûre : présente-t-elle une sécurité suffisante pour éviter que des données soient perdues ou altérées, volontairement ou involontairement ? Fonctionnelle : offre-t-elle des possibilités d'utilisation qui en facilitent l'emploi et qui permettent d'en tirer des conclusions au niveau de la gestion ? En examinant chacun de ces aspects, les auteurs ont procédé en définitive à une analyse de l'ensemble des aspects légaux, informatiques et revisoraux à prendre en compte lors d'un examen de fiabilité d'un système comptable informatisé. Cette démarche, systématique et minutieuse a pour but de guider le lecteur à travers les embûches des logiciels mal conçus, des procédures lacunaires et des velléités indélicates des gestionnaires. Audit comptable, Audit informatique accompagnera utilement les professionnels de l'image financière dans leur quête de la fidélité : comptables, réviseurs, contrôleurs internes ou externes, consultants en informatique.

All Marketers Are Liars: The Power of Telling Authentic Stories in a Low-Trust World
Audio CDs in MP3 / English: MP3, 128 kb/s (2 ch) | Duration: 04:18:58 | 2005 | ISBN-10: N/A | ASIN: B0009WF9EG | 237 MB
Genre: Marketing

Every marketer tells a story. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, which is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better, and look cooler, than $20 no-names…and believing it makes it true.

Successful marketers don't talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story. A story we want to believe.

This is a book about doing what consumers demand; painting vivid pictures that they choose to believe. Every organization, from nonprofits to car companies, from political campaigns to wineglass blowers, must understand that the rules have changed (again). In an economy where the richest have an infinite number of choices (and no time to make them), every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories.

Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or the iPod.

But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That's a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers and Marlboro.

272 <--> Economic Inequality and Political Representation in Switzerland
http://nitroflare.com/view/3AFD6E9FB7E8FB2/3319271156.pdf
https://filejoker.net/5eqbhtw6eqqy


Jan Rosset, "Economic Inequality and Political Representation in Switzerland" 
English | ISBN: 3319271156 | 2016 | 160 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This book analyzes the link between economic and political inequalities and investigates the mechanisms that lead to economically rooted inequalities in the political representation of citizens’ policy preferences. Focusing on the case of Switzerland and evaluating data from the post-electoral survey, Selects 2007, the author demonstrates that the policy preferences of members of the Federal Assembly best reflect those of rich citizens. This pattern is explained by differential levels of political participation and knowledge across income groups, party finance, the fact that representatives tend to come from higher economic strata, and the failure of the party-system structure to reflect the complexity of policy preferences among citizens.

http://nitroflare.com/view/4CCA928BE9609A5/3319269518.pdf

Luigi Paganetto, "Stagnation Versus Growth in Europe: Capitalism in the 21st Century" 
English | ISBN: 3319269518 | 2016 | 228 pages | PDF | 5 MB

This book explores the debate on the policies required to overcome the crises of 2008 and 2011, in which the focus on short-term measures has overshadowed the need to analyze the low growth rate in the European Union, and especially the Eurozone, as the basis for interventions that will counteract the tendency toward stagnation. Factors that lie at the root of the low growth are examined in depth, covering, for example, the impact of the demographic trend toward an aging population in Europe, consequences of inequality for growth, challenges posed by technological change, competition from emerging countries, and difficulties in improving European governance. In addition, potential actions to foster innovation and avoid long-term stagnation, such as new measures to open up markets, stimulate competition in services, and promote green growth, are discussed. The book comprises a selection of contributions presented at the XXVII Villa Mondragone International Economic Seminar, which brought together renowned economists and representatives of a broad range of countries and leading international institutions. It will appeal to all who are interested in the latest thinking on stagnation/growth, inequality, governance, competitiveness, and innovation in Europe.

Monika Bak, "Transport Development Challenges in the Twenty-First Century" 
English | ISBN: 3319268465 | 2016 | 248 pages | PDF | 10 MB

This volume explores the field of transport sector development. Derived from the 2015 TranSopot conference held in Sopot, Poland, it discusses current trends, issues, and research on the topic. Specifically, it aims to explore sustainable development, examines current problems ranging from transport systems to transport enterprises and provides a variety of analytical methods such as economic and econometric analysis.
The three most important fields of current transport research are sustainable transport development, innovation and technological progress and the conditions of transport enterprise growth and survival. Transport is an activity which is supposed to be sustainable, environmentally aware, economically optimal, socially sound and politically responsible. Striving for innovation in transport means looking for organizational and technical solutions which increase the efficiency, effectiveness and safety of transportation. However, the main research issue in the field are strategies for sustainable transport developments in urban and rural areas, instruments of internalization of external transport costs, promotion of environmentally-friendly transport behavior and improvement of transport energy efficiency. Transport infrastructure innovation, intelligent transport systems, innovations in management and finance are some of the main concerns of researchers and policy-makers in the field. Transport enterprises need to adapt to the conditions of the new economic growth perspectives. They need to create unique growth conditions, otherwise they will condemn themselves to struggle for survival. In particular, transport enterprises have to create special functioning systems and programs to diversify economic activity to use funds in the most efficient ways possible.

Aavv - Prodotto interno mafia
Italian | Einaudi | 2011 | ISBN: 8806207989 | 165 pages | EPUB | 3 MB

a cura di Serena Danna. Interventi di Pietro Grasso, Nicola Gratteri, Ivan Lo Bello, Domenico Mogavero, Moisés Naím.
Ragioni storiche, culturali ed economiche hanno contribuito a fare dell'Italia il paese delle mafie: il mancato sviluppo di una cultura imprenditoriale, "la famiglia" come base di tutte le relazioni sociali, la fragile democrazia, il silenzio della Chiesa. Le radici dell'illegalità sono profonde, ma uomini coraggiosi ed eventi globali rivoluzionano gli schemi tradizionali della criminalità organizzata. La sfida è enorme: la mafia domina il processo di globalizzazione o, al contrario, è proprio nei cambiamenti del mondo che si nasconde l'antidoto per sconfiggerla? Un libro che descrive nel dettaglio i meccanismi, le connivenze, i danni e le convenienze di un paese in cui si è sviluppata una forma di capitalismo forse unica al mondo.

Miguel Gómez-Uranga, Jon Mikel Zabala-Iturriagagoitia, "Dynamics of Big Internet Industry Groups and Future Trends: A View from Epigenetic Economics" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 331931145X | 282 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This book applies a new analytical framework to the study of the evolution of large Internet companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and Samsung. It sheds light on the dynamics of business groups, which are approached as ‘business ecosystems,’ and introduces the concept of Epigenetic Economic Dynamics (EED), which is defined as the study of the epigenetic dynamics generated as a result of the adaptation of organizations to major changes in their respective environments. The book augments the existing literature on evolutionary economic thinking with findings from epigenetics, which are proving increasingly useful in analyzing the workings of large organizations. It also details the theoretical and conceptual nature of recent work based on evolutionary economics, mainly from the perspective of generalized Darwinism, resilience and related variety, and complements the work conducted on evolutionary economics by applying the analytical framework of EED. It makes it easier to forecast future dynamics on the Internet by proving that a sizable number of big business groups are veering from their initial paths to take unprecedented new directions as a result of competition pressure, and as such is a valuable resource for postgraduates and researchers as well as those involved in economics and innovation studies.

Steve Woods, "Float Analysis: Powerful Technical Indicators Using Price and Volume" 
English | ISBN: 0471215538 | 2002 | 240 pages | PDF | 9 MB

Powerful Technical Indicators Using Price and Volume 

In Float Analysis: Powerful Technical Indicators Using Price and Volume, active trader Steve Woods introduces you to a powerful new technical analysis tool–his own Woods Cumulative-Volume Float Indicator–that will revolutionize the way you trade. Pushing the boundaries of technical analysis, Woods combines price and volume charts with the knowledge of available shares in the market, or float, to create a strongly predictive indicator that can target winning stocks with incredible accuracy. 

Through his studies of W. D. Gann and a variety of classic charting methods, Woods has discovered a powerful new way of reading price and volume charts. His method–the Woods Cumulative-Volume Float Indicator–analyzes past trading volume to determine a stock's future price direction. It also pinpoints exactly when a float turnover occurs that triggers buy and sell signals. By learning how to identify these patterns, you can begin to predict measurable tops and bottoms, thereby getting in and out of the market with precision timing and unparalleled profits. 

Written in clear, precise language and supplemented with charts and real-world examples, Float Analysis explains every aspect of how and when to use the Woods Cumulative-Volume Float Indicator and details the underlying theory of float analysis behind it. 

This comprehensive trading guide also covers: *Ten breakthrough discoveries that will change the way you analyze stock charts *Support and resistance redefined *Successful trading strategies *How to understand and profit from indicators *How Gann Theory inspired float analysis 

It's hard to find a trading book that charts out a completely new course for the serious trader, but in unveiling this landmark trading technique, Float Analysis has proven to be such a book. Now you can enjoy the benefits of this groundbreaking trading method by applying its winning techniques to your own portfolio. Follow the simple steps outlined in Float Analysis and you too can learn how to use the Woods Cumulative-Volume Float Indicator to make timely and profitable stock purchases.

English | ISBN: 0415620422 | 2007 | 609 pages | PDF | 2,5 MB

This is the first and only book to offer a comprehensive survey of accounting research on a broad international scale for the last two centuries. Its main emphasis is on accounting research in the English, German, Italian, French and Spanish language areas; it also contains chapters dealing with research in Finland, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Russia, Poland and the Ukraine as well as Argentina and Japan. In a time of financial globalization, familiarity with accounting research in countries beyond the English language boundary is no less important than familiarity with the recent, comprehensive research activity in the English language area. It also offers a survey of the present state of the art (from empirical to analytical accounting and from such esoteric subjects as gender issues to the archaeology of accounting); finally, it casts a glance into the future.

Andrew Hall Wedeman, "From Mao to Market: Rent Seeking, Local Protectionism, and Marketization in China" 
English | ISBN: 0521809606 | 2003 | 292 pages | PDF | 2,1 MB

This book argues that economic reform in China succeeded because government failed to prevent local officials from forcing prices to market levels. In the 1980s, reformers opted for a hybrid system of price controls wherein commodities had both fixed and floating prices. Depressed fixed prices led to "resource wars," as localities vied for control over undervalued commodities while inflated prices fueled an investment boom that saturated markets and led to import barriers. Although local rent seeking and protectionism appeared to carve up the economy, in reality they had cleared the way for sweeping reforms.

Simone Borghesi, "The European Emission Trading System and Its Followers: Comparative Analysis and Linking Perspectives" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319311859 | 124 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Given the rapid spread of ETSs in an increasing number of countries and the important role that they are likely to play for the success or failure of the environmental policy in the years to come, this book provides an interdisciplinary analysis of the EU ETS from both the legal and economic perspectives comparing it with the other main ETSs existing worldwide, in order to assess whether the EU ETS has truly represented a prototype for the other ETSs established around the world and to investigate the current perspectives for linking them in the future.
Through the years, the EU ETS has progressively gained a paramount position within the EU environmental policy and climate change legislation and currently represents the most striking flagship in this sector, with more than 11.000 installations covered by the scheme. In parallel, the EU ETS has paved the way for the establishment of many other ETSs in several other jurisdictions. Such schemes are now recognized worldwide as the “cornerstones” of the climate change policy.

The Industries of the Future [Audiobook] by Alec Ross
English | February 2, 2016 | ASIN: B01973762K | MP3@64 kbps | 8 hrs 48 mins | 242 MB
Narrator: Alec Ross | Genre: Nonfiction/Economics/Business

Leading innovation expert Alec Ross explains what's next for the world, mapping out the advances and stumbling blocks that will emerge in the next 10 years - for businesses, governments, and the global community - and how we can navigate them.

While Alec Ross was working as Hillary Clinton's senior advisor on innovation, he traveled to 41 countries. He visited some of the toughest places in the world - from refugee camps of Congo to Syrian war zones. From phone-charger stands in Eastern Congo to R&D labs in South Korea, Ross has seen what the future holds.

Over the past two decades, the Internet has radically changed markets and businesses worldwide. In The Industries of the Future, Ross shows us what's next, highlighting the best opportunities for progress and explaining why countries thrive or sputter. He examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future over the next 10 years, including cybercrime and cybersecurity; the commercialization of genomics; the next step for big data; and the coming impact of digital technology on money, payments, and markets. And in each of these realms, Ross addresses the toughest questions: How will we have to adapt to the changing nature of work? Is the prospect of cyberwar sparking the next arms race? How can the world's rising nations hope to match Silicon Valley in creating their own innovation hotspots?

Ross blends storytelling and economic analysis to give a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, incorporating the insights of leaders ranging from tech moguls to defense experts. The Industries of the Future takes the intimidating, complex topics that many of us know to be important and boils them down into clear, plain-spoken language. This is an essential work for understanding how the world works - now and tomorrow - and a must-listen for businesspeople in every sector, from every country.

Exchange-Traded Funds: Investment Practices and Tactical Approaches
Palgrave Macmillan UK | Finance & Banking | August 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137390948 | 406 pages | pdf | 9.3 mb

Authors: Meziani, A. Seddik

With Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) sponsors constantly making new types of ETFs available, there is now a variety of ETFs that provide investors with an opportunity to develop diversified investment portfolios. Their sophistication has also grown to include a breed of ETFs that do not passively track the performance of an underlying index. With this assortment of newer ETFs, and more on the way, market strategists are now capable of devising all-ETF portfolios based on a multitude of asset allocation schemes that respond to the need of their clients. 

This book provides a comprehensive overview of the changes brought about by ETFs. It describes and analyses recent changes alongside their impact on investment portfolios, and discusses the continuing success of index-based ETFs and the reasons underlying their long-lasting achievements. The book offers an objective discourse on the newly minted smart beta ETFs and some of the issues surrounding them, and provides an overview of how the increasingly widespread ETF-based portfolio hedging strategies are constructed and implemented.

Paying particular attention to the importance of asset allocation and the essential role it plays in portfolio construction, this book explores the role played by ETFs in changing investors’ attitudes toward home bias, covering both established and emerging frontier markets. The author leverages his extensive background to integrate best professional practices and academic rigor for an increased understanding of the ever-evolving world of ETFs.

The Inexorable Evolution of Financialisation: Financial Crises in Emerging Markets By Michailidou Domna M
2016 | 200 Pages | ISBN: 1349575941 | PDF | 1 MB


Since the 2007 financial crisis, discussion on issues related to the size, spread and frequency of financial crises has captivated a wide variety of audiences. Why has the world economy experienced such a marked increase in financial transactions and private and public indebtedness since the 1980s? How have middle-income developing countries suddenly become a part of this dynamic? And, most importantly, how has the topic of financial crises been featured in households daily discussions in both developed and developing parts of the world? Domna Michailidou addresses the questions above through exploring the inexorable evolution of financialisation into financial crisis through the examination of three middle-income countries: Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. Concentrating on emerging economies, and especially choosing three very different economies that all experienced financial crises in the 1990s, this book explores what lessons can be learnt regarding financial fragility, volatility and failure in the wake of capital market liberalisation."

Enacting Dismal Science: New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics (Perspectives from Social Economics) by Ivan A Boldyrev
English | 28 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 1349696811, 1137492104 | 199 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.63 MB

In this book, sociologists, philosophers, and economists investigate the conceptual issues around the performativity of economics over a variety of disciplinary contexts and provide new case studies illuminating this phenomenon. In featuring the latest contributions to the performativity debate the book revives discussion of the fundamental questions: What precise meaning can we attribute to the notion of performativity? What empirical evidence can help us recognize economics as performative? And what consequences does performativity have for contemporary societies? The contributions demonstrate how performativity can serve as a powerful conceptual resource in dealing with economic knowledge, as an inspiring framework for investigating performative practices, and as an engine of discovery for thinking of the economic proper.

Special Economic Zones in India: Status, Issues and Potential (India Studies in Business and Economics) by Arpita Mukherjee and Parthapratim Pal
English | 2016 | ISBN: 8132228049 | 290 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This book examines India’s ten years of experience developing Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and the performance of SEZs in the context of India’s growing international engagement, its endeavours to attract domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing and services and its aim to increase and diversify exports of goods and services. SEZs are industrial enclaves/clusters within a country that receive certain incentives and business facilitation benefits that are not generally available to the rest of the country. To facilitate private and foreign investment in SEZs, India introduced the SEZ policy in 2000, which was followed by the SEZ Act in 2005. After ten years under the Act, India now has one of the largest number of approved SEZs in the world and its SEZ policy remains heatedly debated, with a number of studies arguing both for and against it. Given this background, the book also identifies the challenges faced by SEZs in India and offers policy recommendations on how to make the SEZs an engine for India’s economic growth and development that can more effectively link the country’s manufacturing and services sectors to global value chains.

Klaus Neusser, "Time Series Econometrics" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319328611 | 409 pages | PDF | 6 MB

This text presents modern developments in time series analysis and focuses on their application to economic problems. The book first introduces the fundamental concept of a stationary time series and the basic properties of covariance, investigating the structure and estimation of autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models and their relations to the covariance structure. The book then moves on to non-stationary time series, highlighting its consequences for modeling and forecasting and presenting standard statistical tests and regressions. Next, the text discusses volatility models and their applications in the analysis of financial market data, focusing on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models. The second part of the text devoted to multivariate processes, such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models, which have become the main tools in empirical macroeconomics. The text concludes with a discussion of co-integrated models and the Kalman Filter, which is being used with increasing frequency. Mathematically rigorous, yet application-oriented, this self-contained text will help students develop a deeper understanding of theory and better command of the models that are vital to the field. Assuming a basic knowledge of statistics and/or econometrics, this text is best suited for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

Savvas Katsikides and Hardy Hanappi, "Society and Economics in Europe: Disparity versus Convergence?" 
English | ISBN: 3319214306 | 2016 | 240 pages | PDF | 3 MB

This book takes stock of the lessons to be learned from the experiences of different countries on their way to a transition into a unified Europe. It demonstrates how the project of a unified Europe is a social pilot project that is unique in human history, both with respect to the sheer number of people involved and with respect to the cultural diversity it aims to turn into a progressive advantage. With no historical experience at hand, the transition into a unified Europe is an exploratory process, often risky but sometimes also surprisingly successful. To improve the chances of establishing a successful unification it is particularly important that we learn from the mistakes made so far; and that we learn rapidly, since the forces working against the pilot project of Europe will gain power very fast if the unification success slows down. And as the recent developments in Greece show, the vision of the final goal itself can well change during this exciting quest. Apart from providing the pieces of a mosaic on which a more general theory can be built, this book can be read as a collection of experiences – mistakes as well as triumphs – which should help the European learning process. The structure of the book mirrors Europe’s diversity: specific country studies are combined with more general chapters, and quantitatively oriented econometric work is combined with qualitatively oriented sociological studies.

Manuela Geranio, "Evolution of the Exchange Industry: From Dealers' Clubs to Multinational Companies" 
English | ISBN: 3319210262 | 2016 | 142 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This book describes the dramatic changes that have occurred in the exchange industry during the past two decades. The strategies adopted by major world exchanges during this period are explained and the roles of multilateral trading systems and over-the-counter (OTC) players are clearly described, highlighting their economics and their interconnections with traditional exchanges. Up-to-date, comprehensive comparisons are made of the performances of the main exchanges, and important governance issues are considered. In addition, threats and opportunities for major types of trading venue, deriving either from new regulatory approaches or from the surge in new markets, are presented and discussed with a view to forecasting future developments in the secondary market industry.
The background to the book is the strong erosion in traditional profit drivers for exchanges produced by the progress in communications and trading technology. In many countries, regulation has reduced barriers to entry in the equity field, facilitating a surge in new players and a shift of liquidity toward alternative trading platforms and dark pools.

Francesco Rotondo and Francesco Selicato, "Cultural Territorial Systems: Landscape and Cultural Heritage as a Key to Sustainable and Local Development in Eastern Europe" 
English | ISBN: 3319207520 | 2016 | 386 pages | PDF | 18 MB

This book seeks to enhance the cultural dimension of sustainable development and particularly focuses on minor historic centers and their natural and rural landscapes. In a society becoming ever more globalized, without territorial restrictions in the production of goods and able to reproduce in China the goods and product characteristic of South American crafts (to mention just two extremes), the only element that can still be contextualized is heritage identity: the result of close integration between cultural assets, intangible assets and settled communities.

Thus, heritage identity is one of the few elements, together with natural resources, which has the potential for economic development that is still firmly rooted in places and local populations. These towns are often the centerpiece of urban landscapes and geographical areas with original features, not always but often as individual places within networks of minor historical centers linked by shared history, traditions and/or natural elements (rivers, forests, river systems or other natural elements). They are outside the major tourist networks, even if now there is a budding interest in the touristic exploitation of these environments. So, they are the right places to pursue a sustainable and local development with a cultural perspective.

This book is a product of the VIVA_EASTPART project (Valorisation and Improving of management of Small Historic Centres in the eastern PARTnership region), under the EU-funded “ENPI Eastern Partnership” program. It complements the more practically-focused work that is in production from this group, more focused on empirical approaches to the development of minor historic centers of the nations involved. Though the book has been influenced by this research and working experience, the authors are solely responsible for the content and opinions presented.

http://nitroflare.com/view/63A90FCE311D28D/1138193739_.epub


A Historical Political Economy of Capitalism: After metaphysics by Andrea Micocci
English | 2016 | ISBN: 1138193739 | 220 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

In order to understand the resilience of capitalism as a mode of production, social organization, and an intellectual system, it is necessary to explore its intellectual development and underlying structure.　 

A Historical Political Economy of Capitalism argues that capitalism is based on a dominant intellectuality: a metaphysics. It proposes the construction of a history-based "critique of political economy", capable of revealing the poverty of capitalism's intellectual logic and of its application in practice. This involves a reconsideration of several classical thinkers, including Smith, Marx, Berkeley, Locke, Hobbes, Hume, and Rousseau. It also sketches an emancipative methodology of analysis, aiming to expose any metaphysics, capitalist or none. In doing so, this book proposes a completely new approach in materialist philosophy. 

The new methodology in political economy that is proposed in this volume is an alternative way to organize a materialist approach. Some basic aspects of what is argued by the author can be found in Marx. This book is well suited for those who study political economy and economic theory and philosophy, as well as those who are interested in Marxism.

Martin Hilb, "New Corporate Governance: Successful Board Management Tools (5th Edition)" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3662490595 | 182 pages | PDF | 6 MB

In the 5th edition of this successful book Martin Hilb presents an innovative and integrated approach to the theory and practice of corporate governance. Central to this approach is a set of instruments - developed and tested by the author - that can be used by boards to offer effective strategic direction and control to their organizations. The board instruments can be readily applied to the selection, review, remuneration and development of board members, and for conducting board self-evaluations. This new approach to corporate governance is based on four guiding principles: keep it situational, keep it strategic, keep it integrated, and keep it controlled. Together, these principles form the basis of an integrated approach to all key aspects of corporate governance. The main arguments in each section are supported by conceptual models, practical board tools and case studies, making the book ideally suited to board members, senior managers and post-graduate students. This new edition is updated throughout the book and includes a new chapter on mobile integrated board management and documentation information systems.

English | ISBN: 149393242X | 2016 | 360 pages | PDF | 14 MB

This book takes you on a unique journey through American history, taking time to consider the forces that shaped the development of various cities and regions, and arrives at an unexpected conclusion regarding sustainability. From the American Dream to globalization to the digital and information revolutions, we assume that humans have taken control of our collective destinies in spite of potholes in the road such as the Great Recession of 2007-2009. However, these attitudes were formed during a unique 100-year period of human history in which a large but finite supply of fossil fuels was tapped to feed our economic and innovation engine. Today, at the peak of the Oil Age, the horizon looks different. Cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas are situated where water and other vital ecological services are scarce, and the enormous flows of resources and energy that were needed to create the megalopolises of the 20th century will prove unsustainable. Climate change is a reality, and regional impacts will become increasingly severe. Economies such as Las Vegas, which are dependent on discretionary income and buffeted by climate change, are already suffering the fate of the proverbial canary in the coal mine.
Finite resources will mean profound changes for society in general and the energy-intensive lifestyles of the US and Canada in particular. But not all regions are equally vulnerable to these 21st-century megatrends. Are you ready to look beyond “America’s Most Livable Cities” to the critical factors that will determine the sustainability of your municipality and region? Find out where your city or region ranks according to the forces that will impact our lives in the next years and decades.

Find out how:
·resource availability and ecological services shaped the modern landscape

·emerging megatrends will make cities and regions more or less livable in the new century

·your city or region ranks on a “sustainability” map of the United States

·urban metabolism puts large cities at particular risk

·sustainability factors will favor economic solutions at a local, rather than global, level

·these principles apply to industrial economies and countries globally.

Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told about the Economy Is Wrong [Audiobook] by Edward Conard
English | June 7, 2012 | ISBN: 1470823586, 1470823594 | MP3@64 kbps | 9 hrs 55 mins | 273 MB
Narrator: Malcolm Hillgartner | Genre: Nonfiction/Economics

Unintended Consequences will reward you with a sophisticated understanding of the contemporary economy, one no other book has yet provided.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, many commonly held beliefs have emerged to explain its cause. Conventional wisdom blames Wall Street and the mortgage industry for using low down payments, teaser rates, and other predatory tactics to seduce unsuspecting home owners into assuming mortgages they couldn't afford. It blames average Americans for borrowing recklessly and spending too much. And it blames the tax policies and deregulatory environment of the Reagan and Bush administrations for encouraging reckless risk taking by wealthy individuals and financial institutions. But according to Unintended Consequences, the conventional wisdom masks the real causes of our economic disruption and puts us at risk of a slew of unintended – and potentially dangerous – consequences.

Unintended Consequences is not a book that takes a couple of insights and expands them into three hundred pages; rather, it covers the entire scope of the economy. It's a fascinating and contrarian case for how the economy really works, what went wrong over the past decade, and what steps we can take to start growing again. Whether you agree with the book's provocative and counterintuitive conclusions or not, Unintended Consequences will reward you with a sophisticated understanding of the contemporary economy – one no other book has yet provided.

2016 | ISBN-10: 1119163498 | 320 pages | PDF | 6 MB

A clear, practical guide to working effectively with derivative securities products 

"Derivatives Essentials" is an accessible, yet detailed guide to derivative securities. With an emphasis on mechanisms over formulas, this book promotes a greater understanding of the topic in a straightforward manner, using plain-English explanations. Mathematics are included, but the focus is on comprehension and the issues that matter most to practitioners–including the rights and obligations, terms and conventions, opportunities and exposures, trading, motivation, sensitivities, pricing, and valuation of each product. Coverage includes forwards, futures, options, swaps, and related products and trading strategies, with practical examples that demonstrate each concept in action. The companion website provides Excel files that illustrate pricing, valuation, sensitivities, and strategies discussed in the book, and practice and assessment questions for each chapter allow you to reinforce your learning and gauge the depth of your understanding. 

Derivative securities are a complex topic with many "moving parts," but practitioners must possess a full working knowledge of these products to use them effectively. This book promotes a truly internalized understanding rather than rote memorization or strict quantitation, with clear explanations and true-to-life examples. Understand the concepts behind derivative securities Delve into the nature, pricing, and offset of sensitivities Learn how different products are priced and valued Examine trading strategies and practical examples for each product 

Pricing and valuation is important, but understanding the fundamental nature of each product is critical–it gives you the power to wield them more effectively, and exploit their natural behaviors to achieve both short- and long-term market goals. "Derivatives Essentials" provides the clarity and practical perspective you need to master the effective use of derivative securities products.

English | ISBN: 1615206450 | 2011 | 395 pages | PDF | 5,2 MB

Payment systems are the indispensable infrastructure for financial markets and business activities. Every commercial trade and financial transaction is finalized only when the final settlement is made through a payment system. If operational failures would occur in a payment system, preventing smooth transfers of funds, national economies and financial markets would be thrown into extreme confusion and seriously damaged. Therefore, the safety and efficiency of payment systems is incredibly important for national economies and financial systems to function effectively. 

Payment System Technologies and Functions: Innovations and Developments is valuable tool for those interested in learning about payment systems, including academics and researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, relevant parties of authority and central banks, and professionals in payment business who need a complete understanding of payment systems. This reference promotes a better understanding of payment systems and encourages progress on enhancing the safety and efficiency of payment systems.

Dieses Buch handelt vom obersten 0,1 Prozent der Westeuropäer, von den Superreichen. Alles Geld dieser Welt wird zu ihnen hin gezogen, wie in ein schwarzes Loch. Und Geld bedeutet Macht. Ultimative Geldmacht verändert ganz normale Ansichten, Lebensentwürfe und Verhaltensweisen zutiefst, denn Geldmacht ist eine imperiale Struktur. So werden Milliardäre, ob wir oder sie es wollen oder nicht, eine globale Klasse für sich. Das Schattenreich der Milliardäre ist kein absolutes Mysterium. Es gibt allerdings vieles, was wir darüber noch nicht wissen. Was bedeutet die Konzentration ultimativer Geldmacht? Wer sind diese Superreichen? Wie leben sie? Hans-Jürgen Krysmanski geht diesen und der alles entscheidenden Frage nach: Was macht unbegrenzter Reichtum aus den Superreichen, aus uns und unserem demokratischen Gemeinwesen?

Brazilian Derivatives and Securities: Pricing and Risk Management of FX and Interest-Rate Portfolios for Local and Global Markets by Marcos C. S. Carreira
English | 21 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 1349554723, 1137477261 | 303 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.1 MB

The Brazilian financial markets operate in a very different way to their G7 counterparts. Key differences include onshore and offshore markets, exponential rates, business days day-counts and price formation from the futures markets (instead of the cash markets). Quants, traders, structurers and risk professionals active in this market need to understand these different dynamics in order to be able to effectively map these peculiarities into standard financial engineering techniques and work effectively.

Brazilian Derivatives and Securities is a quantitative, applied guide to the offshore and onshore Brazilian markets, with a focus on the financial instruments unique to the region. It offers a comprehensive introduction to the key financial ‘archaeology’ in the Brazil context, exploring interest rates, FX and inflation and key differences from G7 market finance. The book explores the dynamics of the local markets in detail, including cash instruments when necessary and provides valuable guidance on managing unique situations, from knowing what to do when the time series misbehaves, to how to distinguish volatility from structural changes. Finally, the book introduces the region's unique financial instruments, as well as their pricing and risk management needs. Techniques for interpolation and consistency among different curves are described in detail, and heuristics for potential exposure calculations are developed.

Covering both introductory and complex topics, this book provides existing practitioners in Brazil, as well as those interested in becoming involved in these markets, everything they need to understand the market dynamics, risks, pricing and calibration of curves for all products currently available.

Increase your sales by up to 320% in 30 days! The world’s #1 Sales Trainer has finally adopted his life changing sales system to the online world. The results are staggering!
DEAR FRIEND,

If you could change one thing about your business, what would it be?

Or if you’re on the verge of starting a new business, what’s the one thing you’d want most?

I bet the answer to either question is the same… MORE CUSTOMERS!

I get it!

Most of you know my story. In my mid-twenties I was making tens of millions of dollars every year simply because I was able to overcome that one single challenge.

As a kid, I figured out a way of selling that was so effective, that I literally had more customers than I could handle! I called the system Straight Line Persuasion (SLP).

The problem with having more customers than product; is that you can easily get caught in the trap of selling things you shouldn’t be selling!

I made that mistake and I learnt the hard way. I had invented something powerful, a selling system that was so effective that virtually anyone would be able to implement it and become fabulously successful. I committed my life to teaching this system to honest entrepreneurs around the world, under the condition that I taught business ethics alongside it.

My latest system is taking things to the next level, it’s going to revolutionise the way my students do business for the rest of their lives!

In The Wrong Hands, These Persuasion Tactics Could Be Used To Manipulate Your Customers And The People in Your Life…

Ever since they made a wild movie about my life, and the ridiculous sums of money I was able to make, I’ve been bombarded by fortune 500 companies and top entrepreneurs wanting to learn my system.

I continued to teach it to people, under the condition that it was always implemented with ethics!

No surprise they all made fortunes! I’ve literally created more millionaires than any other sales trainer that’s ever lived. That’s something I’m incredibly proud of!

But there’s a catch! The world is changing fast! I always knew that the information age is going to change the way we do business. If you can’t keep up with the changes you’re going to be left behind! Adapt or die!

The one thing my students could never understand was that SLP is a philosophy. It’s based on the laws of persuasion. To succeed in this new world all you have to do, is adapt the same LAWS to the online world!

I put it to the test. I was consulting a successful digital marketing agency in Australia. I taught the owners Straight Line Persuasion and explained how they could implement the entire philosophy to their campaigns. They implemented everything I taught them and they were BLOWN AWAY! Their average campaign performance went up by 320%!!


They were so shocked by the results that they couldn’t contain their excitement.

I started working closely with these guys and decided that they would be the perfect team to show the world how SLP coul be used online to literally crush your competitors and take your business to a level you didn’t think was possible!

That’s how I created Straight Line Marketing. By the time you’ve completed this program you will literally be a more effective entrepreneur than you’ve ever dreamed possible. You’ll have more customers than you can handle and you’ll be living the kind of life that you deserve to be living!

David Wessel, "In FED We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic" 
English | ISBN: 0307459691 | 2010 | EPUB/MOBI | 352 pages | 2 MB

“Whatever it takes”

That was Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s vow as the worst financial panic in more than fifty years gripped the world and he struggled to avoid the once unthinkable: a repeat of the Great Depression. Brilliant but temperamentally cautious, Bernanke researched and wrote about the causes of the Depression during his career as an academic. Then when thrust into a role as one of the most important people in the world, he was compelled to boldness by circumstances he never anticipated.

The president of the United States can respond instantly to a missile attack with America’s military might, but he cannot respond to a financial crisis with real money unless Congress acts. The Fed chairman can. Bernanke did. Under his leadership the Fed spearheaded the biggest government intervention in more than half a century and effectively became the fourth branch of government, with no direct accountability to the nation’s voters.

Believing that the economic catastrophe of the 1930s was largely the fault of a sluggish and wrongheaded Federal Reserve, Bernanke was determined not to repeat that epic mistake. In this penetrating look inside the most powerful economic institution in the world, David Wessel illuminates its opaque and undemocratic inner workings, while revealing how the Bernanke Fed led the desperate effort to prevent the world’s financial engine from grinding to a halt.

In piecing together the fullest, most authoritative, and alarming picture yet of this decisive moment in our nation’s history, In Fed We Trust answers the most critical questions. Among them:

• What did Bernanke and his team at the Fed know–and what took them by surprise? Which of their actions stretched–or even ripped through–the Fed’s legal authority? Which chilling numbers and indicators made them feel they had no choice?

• What were they thinking at pivotal moments during the race to sell Bear Stearns, the unsuccessful quest to save Lehman Brothers, and the virtual nationalization of AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac? What were they saying to one another when, as Bernanke put it to Wessel: “We came very close to Depression 2.0”?

• How well did Bernanke, former treasury secretary Hank Paulson, and then New York Fed president Tim Geithner perform under intense pressure?

• How did the crisis prompt a reappraisal of the once-impregnable reputation of Alan Greenspan?

In Fed We Trust is a breathtaking and singularly perceptive look at a historic episode in American and global economic history.

English | ISBN: 0767906845 | 2002 | EPUB/MOBI | 225 pages | 3 MB

The world–famous former con artist and bestselling author of Catch Me if You Can now reveals the mind–boggling tricks of the scam trade–with advice that has made him one of America's most sought–after fraud–prevention experts.

"I had as much knowledge as any man alive concerning the mechanics of forgery, check swindling, counterfeiting, and other similar crimes. Ever since I'd been released from prison, I'd often felt that if I directed this knowledge into the right channels, I could help people a great deal. Every time I went to the store and wrote a check, I would see two or three mistakes made on the part of the clerk or cashier, mistakes that a flimflam artist would take advantage of. . . . In a certain sense, I'm still a con artist. I'm just putting down a positive con these days, as opposed to the negative con I used in the past. I've merely redirected the talents I've always possessed. I've applied the same relentless attention to working on stopping fraud that I once applied to perpetuating fraud."

In Catch Me if You Can, Frank W. Abagnale recounted his youthful career as a master imposter and forger. In The Art of the Steal, Abagnale tells the remarkable story of how he parlayed his knowledge of cons and scams into a successful career as a consultant on preventing financial foul play–while showing you how to identify and outsmart perpetrators of fraud.

Technology may have made it easier to track down criminals, but cyberspace has spawned a skyrocketing number of ways to commit crime–much of it untraceable. Businesses are estimated to lose an unprecedented $400 billion a year from fraud of one sort or another. If we were able to do away with fraud for just two years, we'd erase the national debt and pay Social Security for the next one hundred years. However, Abagnale has discovered that punishment for committing fraud, much less recovery of stolen funds, seldom happens: Once you're a victim, you won't get your money back. Prevention is the best form of protection.

Drawn from his twenty-five years of experience as an ingenious con artist (whose check scams alone mounted to more than $2 million in stolen funds), Abagnale's The Art of the Steal provides eye-opening stories of true scams, with tips on how they can be prevented. Abagnale takes you deep inside the world and mind of the con artist, showing you just how he pulled off his scams and what you can do to avoid becoming the next victim. You'll hear the stories of notorious swindles, like the mustard squirter trick and the "rock in the box" ploy, and meet the criminals like the famous Vickers Gang who perpetrated them. You'll find out why crooks wash checks and iron credit cards and why a thief brings glue with him to the ATM. And finally, you'll learn how to recognize a bogus check or a counterfeit bill, and why you shouldn't write your grocery list on a deposit slip.
A revealing look inside the predatory criminal mind from a former master of the con, The Art of the Steal is the ultimate defense against even the craftiest crook.

Ulrich Horstmann, "Die geheime Macht der Ratingagenturen: Die Spielmacher des Weltfinanzsystems" 
2013 | ISBN-10: 3898797937 | 304 pages | PDF | 13 MB

Die Urteile der Ratingagenturen gleichen zuweilen dem kaiserlichen »Daumen runter«, nur wiegen sie ungleich schwerer: Sie besiegeln das Schicksal ganzer Volkswirtschaften. Überfallartig, willkürlich, fatal – so erscheinen die Urteile der drei großen amerikanischen Oligopolisten Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s und Fitch. Gerade diese drei Ratinggiganten aber haben die Finanzkrise entscheidend mitverursacht. Dafür sind sie bis heute nicht zur Verantwortung gezogen worden. Stattdessen agieren sie weiter im Schatten, sind niemandem rechenschaftspflichtig und realisieren astronomische Gewinnmargen, die jedweder Grundlage entbehren. Der Eindruck, einem elitären Geheimzirkel willkürlich ausgeliefert zu sein, ist nicht nur subjektives Vorurteil, sondern wird durch Fakten und Recherche objektiv bestätigt. Ulrich Horstmann bringt Licht in das dunkle Gebaren und die undurchsichtigen Machenschaften der Ratingagenturen. Der langjährige Analyst im Bankengewerbe kennt die tägliche Arbeit der Ratingagenturen so gut wie kaum ein anderer. Er analysiert die Bonitätsherabstufungen, die ganzen Volkswirtschaften abrupt den Boden entziehen, nennt Gewinner und Verlierer dieser verheerenden Politik und prangert das fatale Anreizsystem an, mit denen Ratingagenturen belohnt werden.

332 <--> Börsenerfolg ist (k)ein Zufall. Die besten Investmentstrategien für das neue Jahrtausend

Burton Malkiel, "Börsenerfolg ist (k)ein Zufall. Die besten Investmentstrategien für das neue Jahrtausend" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3932114345 | 1999 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Welche Investment-Strategie ist nun die rentabelste? Welche Strategie kann der Anleger am gewinnbringendsten umsetzen? Die Lösung von Burton G. Malkiel, einem angesehenen Investmentstrategen und Professor der Universität Princeton, die nun erstmals aus dem Englischen übersetzt vorliegt, mag viele überraschen, doch macht sie gerade den Kleinanlegern Hoffnung mit den Anlagestrategen der Großbanken mithalten zu können.

Sehr amüsant beschreibt der Autor zu Beginn verschiedene geplatzte (und immer noch fortwährende) Spekulationsblasen. Er zeigt, wie in der Vergangenheit das KGV (Kurs-Gewinn-Verhältnis) manipuliert wurde, bis man schließlich das "erwartete" (sprich mögliches zukünftiges) KGV bzw. das KCFV (Kurs-Cash-Flow-Verhältnis) erfand. Anschaulich werden die den Kurs beeinflussenden Faktoren wie Dividende, Wachstumsrate, Zinsniveau und Dauer des Wachstums vorgestellt und erläutert. Im zweiten Teil kann sich der Leser einen Überblick über die Analysemethoden der Profis verschaffen. Hierbei porträtiert Malkiel die technische und die Fundamentalanalyse. Nicht ohne treffenden Humor werden diese beiden Strategien mit der Random-Walk-Theorie verglichen. Im Anschluss werden neue Investmenttechnologien, wie beispielsweise die Portfoliotheorie vorgestellt. Auch hier kann sich der Autor seine Spitzen gegen die Anhänger von CAPM (Capital-Asset Pricing Model), BETA (Risiko & Co.) nicht verkneifen.

Im vierten Teil des Buches erhält der Leser nicht nur eine ausführliche Anleitung zur Kapitalanlage, sondern auch noch einen "Investmentführer für jeden Lebenszyklus". Hier stellt Malkiel verschiedene Risikoprofile für unterschiedliche Alterskategorien von Anlegern auf. So kann jedermanns ein persönliches Anlegerprofil bezüglich Risiko, Aufwendungen und Zuflüsse erarbeiten.

Fazit: Börsenerfolg ist kein Zufall wendet sich an erfahrene Anleger, die nicht länger blind irgendwelchen Anlage-Modellen Glauben schenken wollen. Wer auf humorvolle Art Fehler in den Strategien vorgeführt bekommen möchte, und Bestätigung in der Anwendung seines gesunden Menschenverstands sucht, wird mit diesem Buch viel Freude haben und zugleich noch ein paar gute Tipps erhalten. Der einzige Wermutstropfen des Buches ist die Ausrichtung auf den amerikanischen Markt, beziehungsweise den amerikanischen Anleger. D.h. der (deutsche) Anleger muss die Inhalte auf seine Märkte übertragen. –Oliver Satzger

John Bollinger, "Bollinger Bänder: Der einfache Weg, Kursverläufe zu bestimmen" 
2002 | ISBN: 3898790231 | 243 pages | PDF | 61 MB

Erkennen, was wird: Das ist das Ziel, wenn es um die Beobachtung der Aktienkurse geht. Profis der Szene, die sich auch um Theorien der treffsicheren Analyse Gedanken machen, haben verschiedene Charts entwickelt, um diese Vorhersagen aus relevanten Daten der Vergangenheit zu extrahieren. Liniencharts, Barcharts, Candlestick-Charts und Point-and-Figure-Charts sind die bekanntesten und derzeit am häufigsten eingesetzten grafischen Darstellungen als Hilfsmittel für eine Prognose der Aktienentwicklung. Eine Verbindung aus Barchart und Candlestick-Chart stellen die Bollinger-Bänder dar, die in diesem Buch detailliert erläutert werden. Der Autor und Entwickler der Bollinger-Bänder, John Bollinger, gibt in seinem Werk Einblick in die Verfahrensweise und beschreibt einen Weg, die Bollinger-Bänder selbst einzusetzen und zu nutzen. Das beginnt mit der Wahl des richtigen Zeitrahmens für die Analyse, geht hin bis zur Wahl der korrekten Bandbreite und führt zum Erkennen und Auswerten der Chart-Aussagen. Bollinger ist in seinem Buch aber sich selbst und seinen Lesern gegenüber so fair, darauf hinzuweisen, dass auch die beste Technik durch außergewöhnliche Einflüsse Brüche in ihrer Prognosequalität aufweisen kann. Und so gibt er als einen der wichtigen Einsatzbereiche seines Verfahren das Aufspüren von "Gelegenheiten mit gutem Risk-Reward-Verhältnis" an. Dazu, so Bollinger mahnend an seine Leser, bedarf es auch einer gehörigen Protion Selbsterkenntnis, etwa zur Risikotoleranz des Einzelnen. Das Buch ist hervorragende Lektüre für Leser, die – außer natürlich einer Geldanlage – an den mathematischen Verfahren der Chartanalyse(n) interessiert sind. Es bietet unter anderem durch ein ausführliches Kapitel zur Entwicklungsgeschichte dieser Hilfsmittel einen intensiven Einstieg in die Materie. Und gibt Lesern, die sich intensiv in die Welt der Berechnungen und der Bollinger-Bänder eindenken wollen, durch eine Darstellung der Techniken und Auswertungsweisen mit vielen Beispielen gute Anreize, selbst aktiv zu werden. Ein Buch für Connaisseure, Chart-Freaks und mathematisch interessierte Leser, das sich allerdings trotz des amerikanisch-lockeren Schreibstils beileibe nicht zwischen Tür und Angel verschlingen lässt. –Horst-Joachim Hoffmann

Erwann Michel-Kerjan, Paul Slovic, "The Irrational Economist: Making Decisions in a Dangerous World" 
English | 2010 | ISBN: 1586487809 | 336 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Of the twenty most costly catastrophes since 1970, more than half have occurred since 2001. Is this an omen of what the 21st century will be? How might we behave in this new, uncertain and more dangerous environment? Will our actions be rational or irrational?

A select group of scholars, innovators, and Nobel Laureates was asked to address challenges to rational decision making both in our day-to-day life and in the face of catastrophic threats such as climate changes, natural disasters, technological hazards, and human malevolence. At the crossroads of decision sciences, behavioral and neuro-economics, psychology, management, insurance, and finance, their contributions aim to introduce readers to the latest thinking and discoveries.

The Irrational Economist challenges the conventional wisdom about how to make the right decisions in the new era we have entered. It reveals a profound revolution in thinking as understood by some of the greatest minds in our day, and underscores the growing role and impact of economists and other social scientists as they guide our most important personal and societal decisions.

The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business By Charles Duhigg
2012 | 371 Pages | ISBN: 1400069289 | EPUB + MOBI | 9 MB


The Wall Street Journal • Financial Times NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed. Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.

Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right By Jane Mayer
2016 | 464 Pages | ISBN: 0385535597 | EPUB | 1 MB


Why is America living in an age of profound economic inequality? Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers? The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against big government led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system. The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws. The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin s Russia and Hitler s Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights. When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible philanthropy. These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the "Citizens United" decision a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network. The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied. Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy. "Dark Money" is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy."

Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business By Rana Foroohar
2016 | 400 Pages | ISBN: 0553447238 | EPUB + MOBI | 2 MB + 1 MB


Eight years on from the biggest market meltdown since the Great Depression, the key lessons of the crisis of 2008 still remain unlearned and our financial system is just as vulnerable as ever. Many of us know that our government failed to fix the banking system after the subprime mortgage crisis. But what few of us realize is how the misguided financial practices and philosophies that nearly toppled the global financial system have come to infiltrate ALL American businesses, putting us on a collision course for another cataclysmic meltdown. Drawing on in-depth reporting and exclusive interviews at the highest rungs of Wall Street and Washington, "Time" assistant managing editor and economic columnist Rana Foroohar shows how the financialization of America - the trend by which finance and its way of thinking have come to reign supreme - is perpetuating Wall Street's reign over Main Street, widening the gap between rich and poor, and threatening the future of the American Dream. Policy makers get caught up in the details of regulating Too Big To Fail banks, but the problems in our market system go much broader and deeper than that. Consider that: . Thanks to 40 years of policy changes and bad decisions, only about 15 % of all the money in our market system actually ends up in the real economy the rest stays within the closed loop of finance itself. . The financial sector takes a quarter of all corporate profits in this country while creating only 4 % of American jobs. . The tax code continues to favor debt over equity, making it easier for companies to hoard cash overseas rather than reinvest it on our shores. . Our biggest and most profitable corporations are investing more money in stock buybacks than in research and innovation. . And, still, the majority of the financial regulations promised after the 2008 meltdown have yet come to pass, thanks to cozy relationship between our lawmakers and the country s wealthiest financiers. Exploring these forces, which have have led American businesses to favor balancing-sheet engineering over the actual kind and the pursuit of short-term corporate profits over job creation, Foroohar shows how financialization has so gravely harmed our society, and why reversing this trend is of grave importance to us all. Through colorful stories of both "Takers and "Makers, she ll reveal how we change the system for a better and more sustainable shared economic future."

Designing Knowledge Management-Enabled Business Strategies: A Top-Down Approach
Springer | Management for Professionals | August 14, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319338935 | 196 pages | pdf | 7.2 mb

Authors: Mohapatra, Sanjay, Agrawal, Arjun, Satpathy, Anurag
Provides a practical approach to design and implement Knowledge Management Strategy
Focused on aligning KM Strategy with business objectives
Includes five contemporary global case studies

This book provides a practical approach to designing and implementing a Knowledge Management (KM) Strategy. The book explains how to design KM strategy so as to align business goals with KM objectives. The book also presents an approach for implementing KM strategy so as to make it sustainable. It covers all basic KM concepts, components of KM and the steps that are required for designing a KM strategy. As a result, the book can be used by beginners as well as practitioners. 
Knowledge management is a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise's information assets. These assets may include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers. Knowledge is considered to be the learning that results from experience and is embedded within individuals. Sometimes the knowledge is gained through critical thinking, watching others, and observing results of others. These observations then form a pattern which is converted in a ‘generic form’ to knowledge. This implies that knowledge can be formed only after data (which is generated through experience or observation) is grouped into information and then this information pattern is made generic wisdom. However, dissemination and acceptance of this knowledge becomes a key factor in knowledge management. The knowledge pyramid represents the usual concept of knowledge transformations, where data is transformed into information, and information is transformed into knowledge. Many organizations have struggled to manage knowledge and translate it into business benefits. This book is an attempt to show them how it can be done.

Sustainable Water Management: New Perspectives, Design, and Practices
Springer | Pollution & Remediation | August 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 9811012024 | 189 pages | pdf | 5.4 mb

Editors: Nakagami, Ken’ichi, Kubota, Jumpei, Setiawan, Budi Indra (Eds.)
Presents the scientific foundation for integrated water resources management development
Offers three important visions to guide water resource management: theory; social implementation; and harmony between science and society 
Links theory, design, and approaches to decision-making for water resources that integrate broader stakeholder participation

This book takes a new and critical look at the underlying factors that affect the management of water resources, and its content is guided by three important visions. With the “theory” vision, the existing knowledge system for IWRM is reorganized in order to supplement new theories related to our society and science. We then introduce two distinctive case studies on how to achieve sustainable water management. Based on the “social implementation” vision, one study is carried out by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature on Indonesia’s Bali Island, where there is a long history of educational and inspirational local-level water management systems with multistakeholder participation. A further study is based on the “harmony between science and society” vision, and the Ritsumeikan-Global Innovation Research Organization, Ritsumeikan University, proposes innovative water recycling system for the sustainable development of Chongming Island, an eco-island that belongs to China. These two studies highlight “science with society”, a new perspective on science that could promisingly lead to more sustainable futures. This book offers a valuable reference guide for all stakeholders and scholars active in water resources management.

Inbound marketing. Attirare e soddisfare i clienti online By Brian Halligan, Dharmesh Shah, E. Lavagno
2015 | 217 Pages | ISBN: 8848130887 | EPUB, MOBI, PDF (conv) | 10 MB


L'inbound marketing indica una modalità di marketing incentrata sull'essere trovati da potenziali clienti e contrasta con le tecniche tradizionali, dette anche di outbound marketing, che sono imperniate su un messaggio direzionato unicamente verso il cliente. Con l'inbound si passa dal cosiddetto interruption al permission marketing: l'audience va conquistata fornendo contenuti interessanti e utili per il target di riferimento che ne viene quindi coinvolto e attirato. Questo testo è scritto dai fondatori di HubSpot, una delle realtà più di successo nell'ambito dei servizi di inbound marketing. Sono contenute tutte le informazioni riguardati il comportamento dei clienti e le loro preferenze 'digitali'. Tutte queste informazioni trasformeranno il solito marketing online in uno strumento attuale e di grande efficacia. Le chiamate, le mail e così via sono superate, nel mondo online è il cliente che cerca il prodotto di cui ha bisogno e voi dovete farvi trovare. Inbound marketing capisce queste tendenze e delinea le strategie per poter trarre il massimo vantaggio da questo cambiamento di prospettiva. Ma non solo, spiega come convertire i visitatori in contatti con un profilo qualificato e illustra come 'coltivarli' per poter raggiungere il gran risultato del cliente soddisfatto.

Gunter Schmolders, "The Psychology of Money and Public Finance" 
English | 2006 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 1403941696 | PDF | 1 MB

This book features the main papers of Gunter Schmolders (1903-1991), a pioneer in economic psychology for the first time in the English language. Schmolders incorporated psychological considerations in his economic analyses at a time when the distance between the two disciplines was much larger than today. His research on 'fiscal psychology' is of particular and lasting interest, impacting greatly on continental economics. During his lifetime, Schmolders failed to build bridges to enable his contemporary fellow economists to appreciate the importance of his work, however the relevance of his approach is much more obvious in the world's current economic climate.

About the Author
GÜNTER SCHMÖLDERS (1903-1991) was the continental pioneer of Economic Psychology. In the 1950s he built up a centre for socio-economic research at the University of Cologne, Germany. He was a very productive author with over 400 articles and books, with only a few originally published in English.

Genre: Economics, Finance

The finance sector of Western economies is too large and attracts too many of the smartest college graduates. Financialization over the past three decades has created a structure that lacks resilience and supports absurd volumes of trading. In a dazzling and revelatory tour of the financial world as it has emerged from the wreckage of the 2008 crisis, John Kay does not flinch in his criticism: we do need some of the things that Citigroup and Goldman Sachs do, but we do not need Citigroup and Goldman to do them. The finance sector needs to be reminded of its primary purpose: to manage other people's money for the benefit of businesses and households.

This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly
Audio CDs in MP3 / English: MP3, 192 kb/s (2 ch) | Duration: 08:55:41 | 2011 | ISBN-10: 1596596279 | + PDF Book | 773 MB
Genre: Economics

Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing–and recovering–their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, "this time is different"–claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters.

This audio book proves that premise wrong. Covering sixty-six countries across five continents, This Time Is Different presents a comprehensive look at the varieties of financial crises, and guides us through eight astonishing centuries of government defaults, banking panics, and inflationary spikes–from medieval currency debasements to today's subprime catastrophe. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, leading economists whose work has been influential in the policy debate concerning the current financial crisis, provocatively argue that financial combustions are universal rites of passage for emerging and established market nations. The authors draw important lessons from history to show us how much–or how little–we have learned.

Using clear, sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts–as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur.

An important book that will affect policy discussions for a long time to come, This Time Is Different exposes centuries of financial missteps.

A Strategic Understanding of UN Economic Sanctions: International Relations, Law and Development by Golnoosh Hakimdavar
English | 2013 | ISBN: 041553822X, 1138944696 | 214 pages | PDF | 1,1 MB

Economic Sanctions are increasingly used as a legal, non-military technique of combating abusers of international peace. However it remains unclear how the success or failure of these sanctions is measured. This book examines the seldom-explored United Nations’ economic sanctions deliberation process and exposes systematic problems in the measurement of the success or failure of these sanctions. Centering on the key concepts of "peace and security," the author brings the reader’s attention to the discrepancies that exist in the process of decision-making, implementation, and evaluation of UN imposed economic sanctions. She engages international law and development methods to provide proof for the lack of consensus in measures of success and failure, which in turn suggests that sanction implementation on a uniform domestic front are unattainable. This thorough analysis concludes with suggestions for improving the sanctions process, only to clear the path for negating them as a whole and suggest alternative non-coercive measures for mitigating conflict situations and threats to peace and security.

Thorstein Veblen: Economics for an Age of Crises by Erik S. Reinert, Francesca Lidia Viano
English | ISBN: 184331858X | 2012 | PDF | 392 pages | 5,2 MB

After his death Thorstein Veblen was hailed as ‘America’s Darwin and Marx’ and is normally portrayed as the perennial iconoclast. He severely criticised traditional economics and attempted to create an alternative approach based on a much more complex view of human beings. He is one of the most celebrated economists of our age and has been the inspiration for many books; the predatory version of capitalism we now again experience, the phenomenon of studying cultures of consumption and the darker sides of gilded ages can be traced back to Veblen. A conference in Veblen’s ancestral Norway marked the 150th anniversary of his birth. The aim of the conference was to consolidate Veblen scholarship and evaluate his relevance for the problems of today. This collection offers the results of that endeavour; it is a milestone of Vebleniana which assesses all the most salient aspects of his life and influence. Many of its contributors also push into uncharted territory, examining the man and his work from new and necessary perspectives hitherto ignored by scholarship.

Al Brooks, "Trading Price Action Trading Ranges: Technical Analysis of Price Charts Bar by Bar for the Serious Trader " 
English | 2012 | 624 Pages | ISBN: 1118066677 | EPUB | 5 MB

Over the course of his career, author Al Brooks, a technical analysis contributor to Futures magazine and an independent trader for twenty-five years, has found a way to capture consistent profits regardless of market direction or economic climate. And now, with his new three-book series—which focuses on how to use price action to trade the markets—Brooks takes you step by step through the entire process. In order to put his methodology in perspective, Brooks examined an essential array of price action basics and trends in the first book of this series, Trading Price Action TRENDS. Now, in this second book, Trading Price Action TRADING RANGES, he provides important insights on trading ranges, breakouts, order management, and the mathematics of trading. Page by page, Brooks skillfully addresses how to spot and profit from trading ranges—which most markets are in, most of the time—using the technical analysis of price action. Along the way, he touches on some of the most important aspects of this approach, including trading breakouts, understanding support and resistance, and making the most informed entry and exit decisions possible. Throughout the book, Brooks focuses primarily on 5 minute candle charts—all of which are created with TradeStation—to illustrate basic principles, but also discusses daily and weekly charts. And since he trades more than just E-mini S&P 500 futures, Brooks also details how price action can be used as the basis for trading stocks, forex, Treasury Note futures, and options.

Economic Growth and the Environment: An Introduction to the Theory by Clas Eriksson
English | ISBN: 0199663890 | 2013 | PDF | 264 pages | 1,5 MB

Economic Growth and the Environment explores the debate on how to reconcile economic growth with protection of the natural environment, and the closely related discussion on whether an increasing scarcity of natural resources will eventually force economic growth to cease. The debate focuses on whether environmental policies will benefit the economy or not, and is divided into growth optimists and growth pessimists. In general, economists have been optimistic and have pointed to the possibilities of technological progress and substitution, yet they also acknowledge that natural resources and environmental concern do restrict economic growth. The difficulty lies in quantifying the constraint to economic growth. Modern growth economists have constructed models to examine to what extent 'growth pessimism' is theoretically warranted. This book provides an introduction to some of these models, brings together the discussion between growth optimists and pessimists, and presents the theory behind their arguments. It aims to present models where both sides can meet and where both are able to derive expected results with the parameter values that they deem appropriate. From there, the discussions can turn to the empirical observations about these parameters.

This book will be of interest to advanced undergraduates in economics, microeconomics, economic growth, sustainable development, and environmental economics. Each chapter concludes with a set of Exercises designed to help the reader master the models.

Buying, Supporting, Maintaining Software and Equipment: An IT Manager's Guide to Controlling the Product Lifecycle By Gay Gordon-Byrne
2014 | 359 Pages | ISBN: 1482232782 | PDF | 15 MB


Describing how to avoid common vendor traps, Buying, Supporting, Maintaining Software and Equipment: An IT Manager's Guide to Controlling the Product Lifecycle will help readers better control the negotiation of their IT products and services and, ultimately, better manage the lifecycle of those purchases. The book supplies an inside look at the methods and goals of vendors and their contracts―which are almost always in conflict with end-user goals. The text is set up to follow the way most people experience technology products and contracting decisions. It begins by explaining the significance of the decisions made at the time of product selection. It details what you need to focus on when negotiating service and support agreements and describes how to use purchase orders to negotiate more favorable agreements. Explaining how to manage support and maintenance issues for the long term, this book provides the understanding you need to make sure you are more knowledgeable about the products and services your organization needs than the vendor teams with whom you are negotiating.

End of Hyper Growth in China
Palgrave Macmillan US | Economics | August 13, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137537175 | 187 pages | pdf | 3.02 mb

Authors: Zhang, Jun

In this book, Dr. Jun Zhang rebuts the widely-held view that Chinese economic growth is unsustainable due to low consumption and a reliance on exports and enormous fixed-asset investments. Though many believe this “structural imbalance” of the Chinese economy will become a serious problem in the long run, Zhang holds a bullish long-term outlook owing to China's long-term economic development. 
For Zhang, China’s structural problems are greatly exaggerated and certain structures, such as regional governing entities, ensure that China will not face the same economic issues that Japan encountered. Through regional competition, regional governments will persevere; Zhang predicts that China will overtake the US as a superpower. Zhang concludes by acknowledging the real dangers facing China’s economy, and offering advice on the reforms needed to ensure continued growth.

Incompetency and Competency Training: Improving Executive Skills in Sensemaking, Framing Issues, and Making Choices
Springer | Business & Management | August 15, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319391062 | 281 pages | pdf | 7.88 mb

Authors: Woodside, Arch, de Villiers, Rouxelle, Marshall, Roger
Discusses principles of highly reliable organization (HRO) to avoid creating/using incompetent training and adopting incompetent solutions
Shows how to use coaching, checklists, devil’s advocate, and group versus individual evaluation to replace incompetency training
Recommends using asymmetrical thinking and algorithm testing rather than statistical hypothesis testing to reach desirable outcomes

This book covers theory and practice of competency and incompetency training. ‘Incompetency training’ includes formal and informal instruction that consciously (purposively) or unconsciously imparts knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behavior (including procedures) that are useless, inaccurate, misleading, and/or will lower performance outcomes of the trainee versus no training or training using alternative training methods. This book offers an early workbench model of incompetency training theory which proposes that executives and associates in firms, academia, and government organizations consciously as well as unknowingly offer incompetency training in many contexts. The evidence so far has shown that increasing trainees' vigilance and ability to recognize exposure to incompetency-training may help trainees to decrease the effectiveness (impact) of exposures to incompetency training—advancing incompetency training theory and knowledge of incompetency training practice may be necessary conditions for remedying negative outcomes that follow from trainees receiving such training. The book uses a series of laboratory experiments to elicit on tools advocated in the literature as aids in increasing incompetency and/or competency, and provides a comprehensive review of the literature on (in)competency training.

The Ecosystems Revolution
Palgrave Macmillan | Environmental Sociology | September 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319316575 | 170 pages | pdf | 2.45 mb

Authors: Everard, Mark
Offers an overview of the opportunities provided by a better understanding of ecosystem services
Discusses how a better understanding of ecosystem services might enable a co-created future
Provides an authoritative yet accessible overview of the current understanding of this complex and challenging area of environmental science

This book explores humanity’s relationship with the natural world throughout evolutionary history, and the need to reorient this onto a symbiotic basis. It integrates the themes of natural and artificial selection, the characteristics of historic ‘revolutions’, and directed versus random change. Inspiring community-based projects, mainly from the developing world, show how ecosystem regeneration uplifts human livelihoods in a positively reinforcing cycle, embodying lessons germane to co-creating a Symbiocene era wherein humanity’s substantial influence (the Anthropocene) achieves increasing symbiosis with the natural processes shaping the former Holocene epoch. The Ecosystems Revolution provides practical, positive examples, highlighting the attainability of an ‘ecosystems revolution’.

African Cultural Heritage Conservation and Management: Theory and Practice from Southern Africa
Springer | Cultural & Media Studies | August 12, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319320157 | 218 pages | pdf | 4.82 mb

Authors: Keitumetse, Susan Osireditse
Provide a coordinated scholarly and practical approach to African cultural heritage resources conservation so that they fit into the gradually developing field of cultural heritage studies inthe modern world
Introduce theoretical approaches to cultural heritage studies and practice from an African context which is currently missing in the literature on the subject
Provide a point of departure on new management approaches and practices towards cultural heritage conservation using African contexts. This is sought by communities, government,regional and international heritage practitioners to address contemporary social,environmental and economic challenges
Provide a research and teaching guide as well as instructional material to academics interested in African cultural heritage resources

For a long time, resource conservationists have viewed environmental conservation as synonymous with wilderness and wildlife resources only, oblivious to the contributions made by cultural and heritage resources. However, cultural heritage resources in many parts of the developing world are gradually becoming key in social (e.g. communities’ identities and museums), economic (heritage tourism and eco-tourism), educational (curriculum development), civic (intergenerational awareness), and international resources management (e.g. UNESCO). In universities, African cultural heritage resources are facing a challenge of being brought into various academic discourses and syllabi in a rather reactive and/or haphazard approach, resulting in failure to fully address and research these resources’ conservation needs to ensure that their use in multiple platforms and by various stakeholders is sustainable. This book seeks to place African cultural heritage studies and conservation practices within an international and modern world discourse of conservation by presenting its varied themes and topics that are important for the development of the wider field of cultural heritage studies and management.

380 <--> Investigating Identity Theft: A Guide for Businesses, Law Enforcement, and Victims

https://filejoker.net/ynyvj832eq0w


Judith M. Collins, "Investigating Identity Theft: A Guide for Businesses, Law Enforcement, and Victims" 
2006 | ISBN-10: 0471757241 | 272 pages | PDF | 1 MB

What will you do when you encounter identity theft within your business? 

Chances are, you have already lost money to identity theft and business fraud. Look no further than the latest newspaper headlines to know that it is an epidemic problem and an alarming reality from which no business–whether small or large–is immune. 

Although you can′t completely stop identity theft from happening, you can be prepared when it takes place. Investigating Identity Theft: A Guide for Businesses, Law Enforcement, and Victims is your practical guide for fully understanding and investigating identity theft. 

"The training that I received from Judy Collins at MSU has been instrumental to my helping victims of identity theft and locating the person(s) who caused their nightmare. I have even used the training methods she outlines in this book on a homicide investigation and it paid off: the perpetrator is now in jail for the rest of his life. I can′t say enough about Dr. Collins and her knowledge of tracking criminals on the Internet; she is a great asset to law enforcement." 
–Anthony Abdallah, Police Detective, Inkster Police Department (CID), Inkster, Michigan 

"This valuable book is an essential, pragmatic guide for the full understanding and investigation of identity theft crimes. It also establishes Dr. Judith Collins as a foremost national expert on this growing crime problem that threatens our future." 
–Dr. Bruce L. Benson, Police Chief Emeritus, Associate Professor, Criminal Justice, Michigan State University 

"Whether the investigator is working in the private or public sector, Dr. Collins presents valuable information on the methodology required to successfully resolve identity theft cases. The use of real–life investigations, with lessons learned, provides an intriguing and entertaining format while at the same time sharpening the investigator′s skills. If you think investigating identity theft is not worthwhile because the crime is committed by individuals on randomly selected victims without specific objectives, goals, or purpose, you need to read this book." 
–Rod Kinghorn, Director of Investigations, General Motors Global Security 

"An excellent book. Judith Collins has spent many years investigating identity theft. Her willingness to share her knowledge with law enforcement, businesses, and victims is truly a benefit that cannot be found elsewhere." 
–Juli Liebler, Captain, East Lansing Police Department, East Lansing, Michigan 

"Well done. Smart idea. . . . This is an excellent, professionally written book . . . and much needed." 
–Salman Anwar, Computer Forensic Engineer, Western Michigan University Police Department 

"As a retired special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and having worked the past six years in the private sector, I found Dr. Collins′s book to be an invaluable tool for both the private sector and the law enforcement community. Dr. Collins provides genuine insight into the complex issues surrounding identity theft. I am confident her book will assist in both the prevention of identity theft and the detection of those who prey on other′s identities." 
–Frank Laudan, Investigator, Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. 

"Excellent guide! A must–read for anyone involved in investigating identity theft! Dr. Collins has become one of the most respected and knowledgeable authorities in this relatively new field." 
–Detective Gary A. Guiles (Retired), Fraud Investigator, Lansing Police Department, Lansing,

http://nitroflare.com/view/F4EA81E9F3DE542/0566088088.epub


Tim Cooper, "Longer Lasting Products: Alternatives to the Throwaway Society"
English | ISBN: 0566088088 | 2010 | EPUB | 460 pages | 6 MB

The present economic system requires us to consume and throw away more and more goods. Yet often it's our desire, and the best interests of the environment, for these goods to last. The contributors to this book, who comprise many of the most significant international thinkers in the field, explore how longer lasting products could offer enhanced value while reducing environmental impacts. If we created fewer but better quality products, looked after them carefully and invested more in repair, renovation and upgrading, would this direct our economy onto a more sustainable course? The solution sounds simple, yet it requires a seismic shift in how we think, whether as producers or consumers, and our voracious appetite for novelty. The complex range of issues associated with product life-spans demands a multidisciplinary approach. The book covers historical context, design, engineering, marketing, law, government policy, consumer behaviour and systems of provision. It addresses the whole range of consumer durables - vehicles, kitchen appliances, audio-visual equipment and other domestic products, furniture and floor coverings, hardware, garden tools, clothing, household textiles, recreational goods and DIY goods - as well as the re-use of packaging. Longer Lasting Products provides policy makers, those involved in product design, manufacturing and marketing, and all of us as consumers, with clear and compelling guidance as to how we can move away from a throwaway culture towards an economy sustained by more durable goods.

Competition Policy and Price Fixing by Louis Kaplow
English | ISBN: 0691158622 | 2013 | EPUB | 512 pages | 2,4 MB

Throughout the world, the rule against price fixing is competition law's most important and least controversial prohibition. Yet there is far less consensus than meets the eye on what constitutes price fixing, and prevalent understandings conflict with the teachings of oligopoly theory that supposedly underlie modern competition policy.

Competition Policy and Price Fixing provides the needed analytical foundation. It offers a fresh, in-depth exploration of competition law's horizontal agreement requirement, presents a systematic analysis of how best to address the problem of coordinated oligopolistic price elevation, and compares the resulting direct approach to the orthodox prohibition.

In doing so, Louis Kaplow elaborates the relevant benefits and costs of potential solutions, investigates how coordinated price elevation is best detected in light of the error costs associated with different types of proof, and examines appropriate sanctions. Existing literature devotes remarkably little attention to these key subjects and instead concerns itself with limiting penalties to certain sorts of interfirm communications. Challenging conventional wisdom, Kaplow shows how this circumscribed view is less well grounded in the statutes, principles, and precedents of competition law than is a more direct, functional proscription. More important, by comparison to the communications-based prohibition, he explains how the direct approach targets situations that involve both greater social harm and less risk of chilling desirable behavior–and is also easier to apply.

Michael Ellsberg, Bryan Franklin, "The Last Safe Investment: Spending Now to Increase Your True Wealth Forever"
ISBN: 1591846110 | 2016 | EPUB | 288 pages | 2 MB

This bold manifesto will change the way you think about money, wealth, investment, and spending forever.

Myth: If you save for decades and invest in 401(k)s, IRAs, and a home, these investments will grow steadily, allowing twenty to thirty years of secure, peaceful retirement.

Reality: Though this might have been true at some point in the last century, it is not true any longer. If you want to get ahead and enjoy a life of prosperity, you must invest in the last safe investment: yourself, and your own skills, value to others, relationships, and overall happiness.

Business strategist Bryan Franklin and author Michael Ellsberg (The Education of Millionaires) team up here to present a blueprint for building “True Wealth”: the ability to generate not just financial value but also the experiences you cherish most—security, freedom, creative ex­pression, and love.

Discarding traditional advice, Franklin and Ellsberg propose the Self-Amplifying Financial Ecosystem (SAFE) plan. This plan teaches you:

·Small investments you can make for a big im­pact on your value to other people, multiply­ing your earning potential
·The secret to accumulating savings without willpower or deprivation
·How to invest in life’s richest experiences (which money can’t buy)
·The “Super Skills”—the most valuable, sought-after, rewarded, and universally ben­eficial human skills
·Why most people are throwing away huge sums of money in the quest for happiness, and how to spend that money more effectively

388 <--> Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business
http://nitroflare.com/view/324E40D1B22F278/1591846226_1591844002.epub


Bob Lutz, "Car Guys vs. Bean Counters: The Battle for the Soul of American Business" 
English | ISBN: 1591846226, 1591844002 | 2013 | 272 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

“One of the most acute books about management and how com­panies work in practice that I have read in a long time. If anyone wants to know exactly how the U.S. auto industry got into trou­ble, here is your guide.”
—John Gapper, FINANCIAL TIMES

When Bob Lutz got into the auto business in the early 1960s, CEOs knew that if you captured the public’s imagination with innovative car design and top-quality crafts­manship, the money would follow. The “car guys” held sway, and GM dominated with bold, creative leadership and iconic brands like Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, GMC, and Chevrolet.

But then GM’s leadership began to put its faith in numbers and spreadsheets. Determined to eliminate the “waste” and “personality worship” of the bygone creative leaders, management got too smart for its own good. With the bean counters firmly in charge, carmakers, and much of American industry, lost their single-minded focus on product excellence and their competitive advantage. Decline soon followed.

In 2001, General Motors hired Lutz out of retirement with a mandate to save the company by making great cars again. As vice chairman, he launched a war against the penny-pinching number crunchers who ran the company by the bottom line and reinstated a focus on creativity, design, and cars and trucks that would satisfy GM’s customers.

Lutz’s commonsense lessons, combined with a generous helping of fascinating anecdotes, will inspire readers in any industry.

John Truman Wolfe, "The Coming Financial Crisis: A Look Behind the Wizard’s Curtain" 
English | ISBN: 0996968644 | 2016 | 220 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Is there really a Global Financial Ruler? One that dictates policy to the Central Banks of the world? Is there a Central Bank of central banks, that is senior to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of England and the other national banks that control interest rates, inflation, deflation, prosperity and depression? Such a bank not only exists, but John Truman Wolfe exposed this heretofore unseen hand in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and their plans for the next one. No "conspiracy theorist" Wolfe names names, dates, places and actions. If you have ever wanted to know who's behind the Wizard's curtain of international finance and how to protect yourself, start at page one. And make no mistake, the events of 2007 and 2008 were a prelude: The next crisis, Wolfe predicts, will take the "bail-ins" used in the economic meltdowns in Cyprus and Greece and apply them worldwide, leaving depositors and consumers holding the bag, yet again.

Michael E. Porter, "On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition" 
English | ISBN: 142212696X | 2008 | 576 pages | MOBI | 2 MB

For the past two decades, Michael Porter's work has towered over the field of competitive strategy. On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition brings together more than a dozen of Porter's landmark articles from the Harvard Business Review. Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic "The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy," as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. 

This collection captures Porter's unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time.

This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter's work. Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known–frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage. Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society's most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery. Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy. Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership.

393 <--> How You Can Profit From the Coming Devaluation
http://nitroflare.com/view/1A670A5099ABA6D/4871873218.epub


Harry Browne, "How You Can Profit From the Coming Devaluation" 
2010 | ISBN-10: 4871873218 | 206 pages | EPUB | 0,5 MB

Now, we are facing a far greater crisis. The shift from gold and silver coins to paper money caused great concern to economists such as Harry Browne, but now today even the paper money has no value. Nowadays, the world's financial system is carried on Internet websites!!! Trillions of dollars flow back and forth every day through the world's financial markets. If the World Wide Web crashes, there is nothing to back it up. Today, the governments of the world are just creating ever increasing deficits. They are spending like there is no tomorrow. They are just bailing each other out. How much longer can this continue? The "mother" of all financial collapses is upon us NOW. That is why this book is needed more than ever NOW. The world's economy is being run as a giant Ponzi scheme. Governments are bailing out banks and then bailing out each other. The country of Greece was on the verge of collapse until the Government of the United States sent over billions of dollars to Greece to bail it out. Of course, the United States Government did not send real money to Greece. It just made an electronic transfer of funds. The Government of the United States is also bailing out several states of the United States. Who will bail out the United States of America when it collapses, as it must, because of the deficit spending that keeps increasing? The Collapse MUST come. It is inevitable. Our fondest hope has to be that it does not come during our lifetimes, so that only our children and grandchildren will suffer because of it. That is the reason why we need to read and re-read "How You Can Profit from the Coming Devaluation".

Advanced Business Analytics: Essentials for Developing a Competitive Advantage
Springer | Business & Management | August 13, 2016 | ISBN-10: 9811007268 | 156 pages | pdf | 2.96 mb

Authors: Bhaduri, Saumitra N., Fogarty, David
Describes advanced business analytics to enable firms to develop a competitive advantage
Provides a practitioner’s view of business analytics across the enterprise
Focuses on the development and implementation of advanced algorithms to drive improvements in business processes

The present book provides an enterprise-wide guide for anyone interested in pursuing analytic methods in order to compete effectively. It supplements more general texts on statistics and data mining by providing an introduction from leading practitioners in business analytics and real case studies of firms using advanced analytics to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. In the era of “big data” and competing analytics, this book provides practitioners applying business analytics with an overview of the quantitative strategies and techniques used to embed analysis results and advanced algorithms into business processes and create automated insight-driven decisions within the firm. Numerous studies have shown that firms that invest in analytics are more likely to win in the marketplace. Moreover, the Internet of Everything (IoT) for manufacturing and social-local-mobile (SOLOMO) for services have made the use of advanced business analytics even more important for firms. These case studies were all developed by real business analysts, who were assigned the task of solving a business problem using advanced analytics in a way that competitors were not. Readers learn how to develop business algorithms on a practical level, how to embed these within the company and how to take these all the way to implementation and validation.

Revenue Management in Manufacturing: State of the Art, Application and Profit Impact in the Process Industry
Springer | Finance & Banking | August 9, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302396 | 129 pages | pdf | 5.3 mb

Authors: Zatta, Danilo
Includes three empirical studies on revenue management
Summarizes the prerequisites for applying revenue management in manufacturing
Assesses the barriers that hinder the implementation of revenue management

This book focuses on the application of revenue management in the manufacturing industry. Though previous books have extensively studied the application of revenue management in the service industry, little attention has been paid to its application in manufacturing, despite the fact that applying it in this context can be highly profitable and instrumental to corporate success. With this work, the author demonstrates that the manufacturing industry also fulfills the prerequisites for the application of revenue management. The book includes a summary of empirical studies that effectively illustrate how revenue management is currently being applied across Europe and North America, and what the profit potential is.

Sustainability Engineering: A Design Guide for the Chemical Process Industry
Springer | Energy Efficiency | August 10, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319324934 | 188 pages | pdf | 6.77 mb

Authors: Perl, Jeffery
Introduces holistic process designs that emphasizes sustainability as a core requirement from the outset
Demonstrates how to combine chemical, mechanical and natural processes to optimize material and energy utilization in a sustainable manner
Instructs readers on evaluating the overall approach for sustainability within cost and safety constraints
Presents a practical, methodical approach that can be used in industrial settings, as well as for the preparation of young chemical engineers in the capstone course of senior process design

This book explores sustainability engineering through the lens of the manufacturing and chemical process industries to elucidate the safe and economic implementation of process designs used to transform raw materials into useful finished products. The author applies the tenets of sustainability science to develop an engineering methodology that supports the perpetual availability of raw materials through recycling/reuse/repurposing, incorporates inexhaustible supplies, such as solar energy and municipal waste, and encompasses the husbandry of these resources in a manner that minimizes negative environmental impacts. Anyone involved in the design or manufacture of chemicals, or the upgrade of existing manufacturing processes, will benefit from this book’s suggestions for identifying improvement options, while adding the pivotal aspect of sustainability to the usual cost and safety equation optimization elements.

A Flow of Funds Perspective on the Financial Crisis, Volume II: Macroeconomic Imbalances and Risks to Financial Stability By Dr. Bernhard Winkler, Ad van Riet, Peter Bull
2014 | 304 Pages | ISBN: 1137353007 | PDF | 3 MB


Flow-of-funds accounts are a component of the national accounts system reporting the financial transactions and balance sheets of the economy, classified by sectors and financial instruments. The biggest financial crisis in a lifetime has shown how important it is to have a deep knowledge of the financial balance sheets of the main sectors of the economy and the financial flows that take place between them. This type of information is essential for a proper understanding of the transmission of monetary and financial shocks through the economy and to identify macroeconomic imbalances that could undermine financial stability. This publication takes a flow-of-funds perspective of the financial crisis. The book illustrates the broad range of interlinkages between the financial side and the real side of the economy and highlights the role of balance sheet variables and sectoral balance sheet positions in the evolution of the financial crisis, covering the United States, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, Japan and Slovenia. The authors also reflect on the use of financial data in the context of diagnosing and addressing excessive macroeconomic imbalances in Europe and on the use of financial accounts to underpin the analysis of systemic risks in the financial system. In this respect, the flow of funds offers a framework for looking at the right kind of questions when policy-makers consider how to prevent, manage and resolve financial crises.

Advances in Mathematical Economics Volume 20 by Shigeo Kusuoka
English | 7 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 9811004757 | 189 Pages | PDF (True) | 1.92 MB

The series is designed to bring together those mathematicians who are seriously interested in getting new challenging stimuli from economic theories with those economists who are seeking effective mathematical tools for their research. A lot of economic problems can be formulated as constrained optimizations and equilibration of their solutions. Various mathematical theories have been supplying economists with indispensable machineries for these problems arising in economic theory. Conversely, mathematicians have been stimulated by various mathematical difficulties raised by economic theories.

http://avxhome.in/blogs/AlenMiler

Seasonal Adjustment Methods and Real Time Trend-Cycle Estimation (Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences) by Estela Bee Dagum
English | 28 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3319318209 | 300 Pages | PDF (True) | 4.53 MB

This book explores widely used seasonal adjustment methods and recent developments in real time trend-cycle estimation. It discusses in detail the properties and limitations of X12ARIMA, TRAMO-SEATS and STAMP - the main seasonal adjustment methods used by statistical agencies. Several real-world cases illustrate each method and real data examples can be followed throughout the text. The trend-cycle estimation is presented using nonparametric techniques based on moving averages, linear filters and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, taking recent advances into account. The book provides a systematical treatment of results that to date have been scattered throughout the literature.

Seasonal adjustment and real time trend-cycle prediction play an essential part at all levels of activity in modern economies. They are used by governments to counteract cyclical recessions, by central banks to control inflation, by decision makers for better modeling and planning and by hospitals, manufacturers, builders, transportation, and consumers in general to decide on appropriate action.
This book appeals to practitioners in government institutions, finance and business, macroeconomists, and other professionals who use economic data as well as academic researchers in time series analysis, seasonal adjustment methods, filtering and signal extraction. It is also useful for graduate and final-year undergraduate courses in econometrics and time series with a good understanding of linear regression and matrix algebra, as well as ARIMA modelling.

The Globalization Paradox: Democracy and the Future of the World Economy
Audio CDs in MP3 / English: MP3, 56 kb/s (1 ch) | Duration: 10:31:56 | 2013 | ISBN-10: N/A | ASIN: B00CLX9BLI | 150 MB
Genre: Economy

In this eloquent challenge to the reigning wisdom on globalization, Dani Rodrik reminds us of the importance of the nation-state, arguing forcefully that when the social arrangements of democracies inevitably clash with the international demands of globalization, national priorities should take precedence. Combining history with insight, humor with good-natured critique, Rodrik's case for a customizable globalization supported by a light frame of international rules shows the way to a balanced prosperity as we confront today's global challenges in trade, finance, and labor markets.

Macroeconomics, Trade, and Social Welfare
Springer | Business & Economics | August 12, 2016 | ISBN-10: 4431558055 | 235 pages | pdf | 4.42 mb

Authors: Ohyama, Michihiro
Introduces new methodologies in economic analysis
Provides a theoretical reexamination of modern trade and macroeconomic policies
Presents the neo-Keynesian (or mixed economy) synthesis of macroeconomic theory

This book develops new, original methods of welfare comparison and comparative dynamics between distinct and discretely positioned (rather than continuously related) socioeconomic situations. These methods are not only realistic but also extremely relevant to serious economic problems. Using them, the book sheds illuminating new light on the theoretical analysis of Keynesian economics and other important issues of political economy. For instance, it shows that the principle of effective demand applies exactly as Keynes put it to the unemployment equilibrium in the short run. It also shows that the equilibrium may change along the expansion path as the government chooses to vary its expenditure to maximize national welfare. The same methods are effectively employed theoretically to investigate modern trade policy issues such as gains from trade, the theory of tariffs, free trade agreements, and the role of the WTO. Those methods are also used to study the welfare and efficiency of various socioeconomic situations.

410 <--> The Theory of Extensive Form Games

The Theory of Extensive Form Games
Springer | Economic Theory | August 9, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3662499428 | 248 pages | pdf | 3.12 mb

Authors: Alós-Ferrer, Carlos, Ritzberger, Klaus
Addresses extensive form games in full generality without any finiteness assumptions
Synthesizes earlier approaches to the representation of extensive form games
Includes numerous examples and illustrations that help to develop intuition

This book treats extensive form game theory in full generality. It provides a framework that does not rely on any finiteness assumptions at all, yet covers the finite case. The presentation starts by identifying the appropriate concept of a game tree. This concept represents a synthesis of earlier approaches, including the graph-theoretical and the decision-theoretical ones. It then provides a general model of sequential, interpersonal decision making, called extensive decision problems. Extensive forms are a special case thereof, which is such that all strategy profiles induce outcomes and do so uniquely. Requiring the existence of immediate predecessors yields discrete extensive forms, which are still general enough to cover almost all applications. The treatment culminates in a characterization of the topologies on the plays of the game tree that admit equilibrium analysis.

Work Stress and Health in a Globalized Economy: The Model of Effort-Reward Imbalance
Springer | Psychology | August 7, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319329359 | 378 pages | pdf | 5.57 mb

Editors: Siegrist, Johannes, Wahrendorf, Morten (Eds.)
Is the only available updated summary of 20 years of research
Presents comparative cross-country research using identical methods
Is an important reference for researchers, occupational health professionals, and policy makers

This book provides a comprehensive, updated summary of research evidence on the effects of stressful working and employment conditions on workers’ health, as based on one of the worldwide leading theoretical models, effort-reward imbalance. It offers three innovative features that are appealing for research as well as for policy. 
Firstly, it presents and discusses comparable research findings from different continents, in particular from Japan, China, and Latin America. Secondly, it extends the conceptual framework of research on this topic by analysing associations of work stress with health in a life course perspective, and by linking these associations to the macro-level of national labour and social policies. Thirdly, the book helps to strengthen programs and policies that aim at promoting healthy work locally, nationally, and internationally, by providing solid facts on which such programs can be based.

Handbook of Operations Analytics Using Data Envelopment Analysis
Springer | Business & Management | August 2, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1489977031 | 572 pages | pdf | 6.08 mb

Editors: Hwang, Shiuh-Nan, Lee, Hsuan-Shih, Zhu, Joe (Eds.)
Editor (Zhu) is one of the most prominent researchers in the field
Only book to explore using DEA in addition to other decision techniques
Prestigious and international group of contributing authors

This handbook focuses on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) applications in operations analytics which are fundamental tools and techniques for improving operation functions and attaining long-term competitiveness. In fact, the handbook demonstrates that DEA can be viewed as Data Envelopment Analytics.
Chapters include a review of cross-efficiency evaluation; a case study on measuring the environmental performance of OECS countries; how to select a set of performance metrics in DEA with an application to American banks; a relational network model to take the operations of individual periods into account in measuring efficiencies; how the efficient frontier methods DEA and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) can be used synergistically; and how to integrate DEA and multidimensional scaling.
In other chapters, authors construct a dynamic three-stage network DEA model; a bootstrapping based methodology to evaluate returns to scale and convexity assumptions in DEA; hybridizing DEA and cooperative games; using DEA to represent the production technology and directional distance functions to measure band performance; an input-specific Luenberger energy and environmental productivity indicator; and the issue of reference set by differentiating between the uniquely found reference set and the unary and maximal types of the reference set.
Finally, additional chapters evaluate and compare the technological advancement observed in different hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) market segments over the past 15 years; radial measurement of efficiency for the production process possessing multi-components under different production technologies; issues around the use of accounting information in DEA; how to use DEA environmental assessment to establish corporate sustainability; a summary of research efforts on DEA environmental assessment applied to energy in the last 30 years; and an overview of DEA and how it can be utilized alone and with other techniques to investigate corporate environmental sustainability questions.

During the global economic crisis of 2008, countries around the world used national policy spaces to respond to the economic crisis in ways that shed new light on the possibilities for linkages between international trade and human rights. This book introduces the idea of policy space as an innovative way to reframe recent developments in global governance. It brings together a wide-ranging group of leading experts in international law, trade, human rights, political economy, international relations, and public policy who have been asked to reflect on this important development in globalization. Their multidisciplinary contributions provide explanations for why the global landscape for national policy space has changed, clearly illustrate instances of this change, and project the future paths for policy development in social and economic policy spaces, especially with reference to linkages between international trade and human rights in countries from the Global North as well as Brazil, China, and India.

Interdisciplinary approach to global governance post-financial crisis
Provides a strong emphasis on original research that gives the reader a new way to engage with globalization
Brings together a distinct group of scholars from the Global North and South

2015 | ISBN: 1442255196, 1442257237 | English | 302 pages | EPUB/AZW3 | 1 MB/1 MB

The economy of the United States is constantly evolving in response to wars, technological innovations, cultural revolutions, and political maneuverings. Tracing the economic machine of the United States from its first experiments in the colonies to the post–Great Recession era of today, Frederick S. Weaver creates a dynamic narrative of this country’s progression through times of feast and times of famine. Weaver explores diverse areas of the market beyond the financial sector, examining historical fluctuations in distribution of income, how the ebb and flow of specific industries have influenced the shape of the market, and, ultimately, how the economy of the United States has made America the nation we know today. Conquest, Conflict, and Struggles for Equality: An Economic History of the United States is a thoughtful and accessible introduction to the subject of American economic history, suitable for undergraduate courses in US political and economic history.

418 <--> Securing Your Financial Future: Complete Personal Finance for Beginners
http://nitroflare.com/view/3158228F3F4CFA0/1442214228.pdf


Securing Your Financial Future: Complete Personal Finance for Beginners by Chris Smith
2012 | ISBN: 1442214228 | English | 340 pages | PDF | 2 MB

When it comes to personal finance, the rules may have changed, but the time-tested principles of sound personal financial management haven't. Those starting out on their paths to financial security just need to learn them better and apply them earlier than ever before - ideally, right from the start.

Previous generations have had some help in achieving financial security that young people can't count on today: generous employer pensions, steady housing price increases, and a well-funded Social Security program, to name a few. In short, the old "muddle through" approach won't cut it anymore - not even close. A steady income is still a must, but parlaying this into long-term financial security is now an entirely different proposition than ever before. The institutions of the past can no longer be relied upon to handle the process; each person now needs to manage the long-term financial planning and decision making on their own.

Fortunately, though, anyone just starting out can still achieve a very strong financial future from almost any income level - but only by doing the right things to make it happen. Those things aren't particularly hard to understand or to do, but it is important to do them right, to do them consistently, and to do them in the right order. Most importantly, if you get an early start, the risks are minimal and the payoff is substantial. But each year that passes, the risks go up and the payoff goes down. If you have just started out in your financial life, or if you are just about to, and you want a complete and practical education in the fundamentals of personal finance for a secure future, then this book is for you. Chris Smith guides readers through the basics of saving, investing, and financial planning in language that is clear, accessible, and lively, making difficult concepts understandable to the novice, and enjoyable to those who already have some understanding. He shows readers how to apply this knowledge, and to avoid the most common pitfalls, to insure the best possible outcome for long-term financial security.

420 <--> Who Cooked Adam Smith's Dinner?: A Story of Women and Economics
http://nitroflare.com/view/41BC82E0852264B/168177142X.epub


Who Cooked Adam Smith's Dinner?: A Story of Women and Economics by Katrine Marcal
2016 | ISBN: 168177142X | English | 240 pages | EPUB | 0.7 MB

A funny, clever, and thought-provoking examination of the myth of the "economic man" and its impact on the global economy

How do you get your dinner? That is the basic question of economics. When economist and philosopher Adam Smith proclaimed that all our actions were motivated by self-interest, he used the example of the baker and the butcher as he laid the foundations for 'economic man.' He argued that the baker and butcher didn't give bread and meat out of the goodness of their hearts. It's an ironic point of view coming from a bachelor who lived with his mother for most of his life ― a woman who cooked his dinner every night.

Nevertheless, the economic man has dominated our understanding of modern-day capitalism, with a focus on self-interest and the exclusion of all other motivations. Such a view point disregards the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking. It insists that if women are paid less, then that's because their labor is worth less. Economics has told us a story about how the world works and we have swallowed it, hook, line and sinker. This story has not served women well. Now it's time to change it.

A kind of femininst Freakonomics, Who Cooked Adam Smith’s Dinner? charts the myth of economic man ― from its origins at Adam Smith's dinner table, its adaptation by the Chicago School, and its disastrous role in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis ― in a witty and courageous dismantling of one of the biggest myths of our time.

Professor T. V. Paul, "International Relations Theory and Regional Transformation" 
English | ISBN: 1107604559, 1107020212 | 2012 | 320 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Regional transformation has emerged as a major topic of research during the past few decades, much of it seeking to understand how a region changes into a zone of conflict or cooperation and how and why some regions remain in perpetual conflict. Although the leading theoretical paradigms of international relations have something to say about regional order, a comprehensive treatment of this subject is missing from the literature. This book suggests that cross-paradigmatic engagement on regional orders can be valuable if it can generate theoretically innovative, testable propositions and policy-relevant ideas. The book brings together scholars from the dominant IR perspectives aiming to explain the regional order issue through multidimensional and multi-causal pathways and seeking meeting points between them. Using insights from IR theory, the contributors offer policy-relevant ideas which may benefit conflict-ridden regions of the world.

Heads I Win, Tails I Win: Why Smart Investors Fail and How to Tilt the Odds in Your Favor by Spencer Jakab
2016 | ISBN: 0399563202 | English | 288 pages | EPUB/MOBI | 0.6 MB/1 MB

INVESTING IS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS IN LIFE WHERE EVEN VERY SMART PEOPLE LET HOPE TRIUMPH OVER EXPERIENCE 

According to Wall Street Journal investing colum­nist Spencer Jakab, most of us have no idea how much money we’re leaving on the table—or that the average saver doesn’t come anywhere close to earning the “average” returns touted in those glossy brochures. We’re handicapped not only by psychological biases and a fear of missing out, but by an industry with multimillion-dollar marketing budgets and an eye on its own bottom line, not yours. 

Unless you’re very handy, you probably don’t know how to fix your own car or give a family member a decent haircut. But most Americans are expected to be part-time fund managers. With a steady, livable pension check becoming a rarity, we’ve been entrusted with our own finances and, for the most part, failed miserably. 

Since leaving his job as a top-rated stock ana­lyst to become an investing columnist, Jakab has watched his readers—and his family, friends, and colleagues—make the same mistakes again and again. He set out to evaluate the typical advice people get, from the clearly risky to the seemingly safe, to figure out where it all goes wrong and how they could do much better. 
Blending entertaining stories with some sur­prising research, Jakab explains 

·How a typical saver could have a retirement nest egg twice as large by being cheap and lazy. 
·Why investors who put their savings with a high-performing mutual fund manager end up worse off than if they’d picked one who has struggled. 
·The best way to cash in on your hunch that a recession is looming. 
·How people who check their brokerage accounts frequently end up falling behind the market. 
·Who isn’t nearly as good at investing as the media would have you think. 

He also explains why you should never trust a World Cup–predicting octopus, why you shouldn’t invest in companies with an X or a Z in their names, and what to do if a time traveler offers you eco­nomic news from the future. 

Whatever your level of expertise, Heads I Win, Tails I Win can help you vastly improve your odds of investment success.

Numbersense: How to Use Big Data to Your Advantage By Kaiser Fung

How to make simple sense of complex statistics--from the author of Numbers Rule Your World We live in a world of Big Data--and it's getting biggerevery day. Virtually every choice we make hinges on how someone generates data . . . and how someone else interprets it--whether we realize it or not. Where do you send your child for the best education?Big Data. Which airline should you choose to ensure a timely arrival? Big Data. Who will you vote for in the next election? Big Data. The problem is, the more data we have, the more difficult it is to interpret it. From world leaders to average citizens, everyone is prone to making critical decisions based on poor data interpretations. In Numbersense, expert statistician Kaiser Fungexplains when you should accept the conclusions of the Big Data "experts"--and when you should say, "Wait . . . what?" He delves deeply into a wide range of topics, offering the answers to important questions, such as: Don't take for granted statements made in the media, by our leaders, or even by your best friend. We're on information overload today, and there's a lot of bad information out there. Numbersense gives you the insight into how BigData interpretation works--and how it too often doesn't work. You won't come away with the skills of a professional statistician. But you will have a keen understanding of the data traps even the best statisticians can fall into, and you'll trust the mentalalarm that goes off in your head when something just doesn't seem to add up.

432 <--> The Origins of Neoliberalism: Modeling the Economy from Jesus to Foucault
http://nitroflare.com/view/87D926765BAAC66/0231177763.pdf


The Origins of Neoliberalism: Modeling the Economy from Jesus to Foucault by Dotan Leshem
2016 | ISBN: 0231177763 | English | 248 pages | PDF | 5 MB

Dotan Leshem recasts the history of the West from an economic perspective, bringing politics, philosophy, and the economy closer together and revealing the significant role of Christian theology in shaping economic and political thought. He begins with early Christian treatment of economic knowledge and the effect of this interaction on ancient politics and philosophy. He then follows the secularization of the economy in liberal and neoliberal theory.

Leshem draws on Hannah Arendt's history of politics and Michel Foucault's genealogy of economy and philosophy. He consults exegetical and apologetic tracts, homilies and eulogies, manuals and correspondence, and Church canons and creeds to trace the influence of the economy on Christian orthodoxy. Only by relocating the origins of modernity in Late Antiquity, Leshem argues, can we confront the full effect of the neoliberal marketized economy on contemporary societies. Then, he proposes, a new political philosophy that re-secularizes the economy will take shape and transform the human condition.

Eric D Cruikshank, "Distressed Financial Markets:Navigating the Shoals of Liquidity Risk" 
English | ISBN: 1843745437 | 2008 | 248 pages | PDF | 3 MB

The book examines the characteristics of different financial systems and markets, including the importance of their legal underpinnings and organisational arrangements, and their role in transmitting financial distress. It complements this structural focus with brief case studies of a number of country-level financial crises, including the ongoing 2008 credit crunch which began in the United States in the sub-prime mortgage market and is spreading globally and to other segments of the financial markets.

English | ISBN: 9814407232 | 2013 | 200 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Touted as one of the main engineers of Singapore's economic growth, Dr Goh's collection of writings and speeches seek to shed light on the various challenges that China faced in the early 90s. His arguments and analyses were presented clearly and concisely while being firmly established upon economic principles. Covering a broad range of topics from the growth of industries and enterprises to financial reforms and the difficulties of doing business in China, this collection provides a comprehensive view of problems the Chinese government faced while providing possible solutions. Despite being written two decades ago, the issues raised in these papers and speeches are uncannily relevant to the issues that the current Chinese government faces today.

http://nitroflare.com/view/AB4AF5DCC5D88A1/1137500174.pdf
https://filejoker.net/uohzb800yvjy


Alan Cafruny, Leila Simona Talani, "The Handbook of Critical International Political Economy" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 1137500174, 1349698768 | 469 pages | PDF | 11 MB

Challenging the assumptions of ‘mainstream’ International Political Economy (IPE), this Handbook demonstrates the considerable value of critical theory to the discipline through a series of cutting-edge studies. The field of IPE has always had an inbuilt vocation within Historical Materialism, with an explicit ambition to make sense, from a critical standpoint, of the capitalist mode of production as a world system of sometimes paradoxically and sometimes smoothly overlapping states and markets. Having spearheaded the growth of a vigorous critical scholarship in the 1960s and 1970s, however, Marxism and neo-Gramscian approaches became increasingly marginalized over the course of the 1980s. The authors respond to the exposure of limits to mainstream contemporary scholarship in the wake of the onset of the Global Financial Crisis, and provide a comprehensive overview of the field of Critical International Political Economy. Problematizing socioeconomic and political structures, and considering these as potentially transitory and subject to change, the contributors aim not simply to understand a world of conflict, but furthermore to uncover the ways in which purportedly objective analyses reflect the interests of those in positions of privilege and power.

Springer | Business | August 6, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319422723 | 81 pages | pdf | 2.02 mb

Authors: Marletto, G., Franceschini, S., Ortolani, C., Sillig, C.
Provides readers with new tools for analyzing the positioning of innovators and their networks, and for devising alternative transition pathways and design policies for a sustainability transition
Includes three sectorial case studies concerning urban mobility, agri-food, and lighting
Written for business managers, policymakers, students, and all those who want to understand how a “greening” of our society could emerge from current innovations

This book was written for anyone wishing to understand how sustainable scenarios emerge from current innovations. It complements current sustainability transition research by providing a “socio-technical map,” an analytical and operational tool that can be used to explain the current positioning of innovators and their networks; to form alternative transition pathways and scenarios; and to design policies for a sustainability transition. Drawing on multiple disciplinary approaches to the study of “green” innovations and focusing specifically on operational directives, it examines and assesses multiple transition pathways (and supporting networks). Lastly, it presents three sectorial case studies (urban mobility, agri-food, and lighting) to demonstrate how the “socio-technical map” can be concretely put into practice.

Brian Czech, "Supply Shock: Economic Growth at the Crossroads and the Steady State Solution" 
2013 | ISBN-10: 0865717443 | 384 pages | PDF | 18 MB

Politicians, economists, and Wall Street would have us believe that limitless economic expansion is the Holy Grail, and that there is no conflict between growing the economy and protecting the environment. Supply Shock debunks these widely accepted myths and demonstrates that we are in fact navigating the end of the era of economic growth, and that the only sustainable alternative is the development of a steady state economy. Starting with a refreshingly accessible, comprehensive critique of economic growth, the author engages readers in an enormous topic that affects everyone in every country. Publishers Weekly favorably compared Brian Czech to Carl Sagan for popularizing their difficult subjects; Supply Shock shows why. Czech presents a compelling alternative to growth based on keen scientific, economic, and political insights including: * The "trophic theory of money"* The overlooked source of technological progress that prevents us from reconciling growth and environmental protection* Bold yet practical policies for establishing a steady state economy Supply Shock leaves no doubt that the biggest idea of the twentieth century–economic growth–has become the biggest problem of the twenty-first. Required reading for anyone concerned about the world our children and grandchildren will inherit, this landmark work lays a solid foundation for a new economic model, perhaps in time for preventing global catastrophes; certainly in time for lessening the damages. Brian Czech is the founder of Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE), the leading organization promoting the transition from unsustainable growth to a new economic paradigm.

Co-production in the Public Sector: Experiences and Challenges (SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology) by Mariagrazia Fugini
English | 5 July 2016 | ISBN: 3319305565 | 148 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

This book examines the various ways in which co-production can contribute to the creation, design, and delivery of public services, namely by engaging the expertise of users and their networks, by promoting public services that are better targeted and more responsive to users, by cutting costs against the background of austerity in public finance, by creating a synergy between government and civil society that will impact positively on social capital, and by addressing the challenges resulting from growing democratic and citizenship deficits. Particular attention is paid to local government and the health and social care sector. After definition of the concept of co-production, the critical issues which arise when public services are co-produced are discussed. Various experiences of co-production are presented and analyzed with a view to highlighting why, how, and with what effect public service co-production may be implemented. Individual chapters focus on the impact of co-production in making cities smarter and the use of ICT in supporting co-production of public services. The book will be of relevance to a wide readership, from students to academics and professionals interested or engaged in public service management.

Strategies for Symbiotic Urban Neighbourhoods: Towards Local Energy Self-Sufficiency (SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology) by Sophie Lufkin
English | 16 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3319256084 | 80 Pages | PDF (True) | 4.14 MB

Utilizing the results of a case study on the Gare-Lac sector in the city of Yverdon-les-Bains – the site is currently a large urban brownfield, intended to host ca. 3,800 additional inhabitants and 1,200 jobs upon completion – this work examines how to design attractive urban neighbourhoods that generate endogenous economic activity and foster socio-cultural dynamics, while moving towards local energy self-sufficiency.

Exploring the different dimensions influencing energy self-sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale by integrating parameters related to buildings, infrastructure, mobility, food, goods and services, the work focuses on three scenarios (technological, behavioural and symbiotic) for the future development of this neighbourhood through 2035. The scenarios test different design strategies related to industrial symbioses, production, storage, transportation, and urban agriculture.

Building Societies in the Financial Services Industry by Barbara Casu
English | 4 July 2016 | ISBN: 1137602074 | 99 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.73 MB

This book presents an analysis of the role of UK building societies, their strengths and weaknesses, and their contribution to the industry, at a time where public confidence in banking is low. Chapters present the results of an empirical analysis of the comparative performance of UK building societies, since the large-scale demutualisation process ended in the year 2000. The authors highlight the substantial impact of the financial crisis on the sector, with 2008 and 2009 being particularly difficult years. The book discusses banks and building societies in the context of the improving economy and show that both groups have recovered some profitability, although not at the pre-crisis level. The reader will discover that building societies in particular have recovered well from the financial turmoil and they appear less risky than banks on a variety of measures.

https://filejoker.net/bsfg25rgqqvu


Steve W. Martin, "Heavy Hitter Selling: How Successful Salespeople Use Language and Intuition to Persuade Customers to Buy" 
2006 | ISBN-10: 0471787000 | 384 pages | PDF | 14 MB

What separates ordinary salespeople from Heavy Hitters? 

The best salespeople are those "Heavy Hitters" who are able to use human nature, language, and intuition to build trusting relationships with customers and persuade them to buy. Based on his proven and effective sales program, author Steve Martin′s Heavy Hitter Selling explains how you too can achieve and maintain that high level of sales success. Using real–world case studies, examples, and exercises, Martin provides the psychological, physical, and language–based tactics you need to turn yourself into a Heavy Hitter.

Inside, you′ll find proven guidance and expert tips on:
Understanding how people think and communicate
Finding the right words at the right time
Predicting a customer′s behavior and influencing his thoughts
Building customer rapport and understanding their motivations
Persuading both the customer′s rational mind and his emotional subconscious side

"Like other sales books published recently, this one stresses the importance of human behavior. But unlike the others, it puts an emphasis on language. Salespeople could well benefit by exploring scientific models of language. Practical exercises make the book useful for everyone."
Harvard Business School Review

"This well–written, insightful book will give you ideas and strategies you can use to influence and persuade customers in any market."
Brian Tracy, author, Million Dollar Habits

"Traditional selling focuses on product, price, and competition and misses the most important reason people buy–people and emotion. Heavy Hitter Selling offers a different perspective that is valuable in understanding how to win."
Jay Fulcher, President and COO, Agile Software

"Heavy Hitter Selling is different–[a book that] will help you make lots of money."

Mark Jonathan Paul Anson, "Handbook of Alternative Assets (2nd edition)" 
2006 | ISBN-10: 047198020X | 720 pages | PDF | 16 MB

Since the first edition of the Handbook of Alternative Assets was published, significant events-from the popping of the technology bubble and massive accounting scandals to recessions and bear markets-have shifted the financial landscape. These changes have provided author Mark J. P. Anson with an excellent opportunity to examine alternative assets during a different part of the economic cycle than previously observed in the first edition.

Fully revised and updated to reflect today's financial realities, the Handbook of Alternative Assets, Second Edition covers the five major classes of alternative assets-hedge funds, commodity and managed futures, private equity, credit derivatives, and corporate governance-and outlines the strategies you can use to efficiently incorporate these assets into any portfolio. Throughout the book, new chapters have been added, different data sources accessed, and new conclusions reached.

Designed as both an introduction to the world of alternative assets and as a reference for the active investor, the Handbook of Alternative Assets, Second Edition will help you match alternative assets with your various investment goals.

Strategic Management for the Plastics Industry: Dealing with Globalization and Sustainability (2nd Edition) By Roger F. Jones
2013 | 178 Pages | ISBN: 1466505869 | PDF | 1 MB


Any general management book can give you the basics of quality assurance, strategic planning, logistics, and more. But how do you apply that knowledge to a company that requires not only sound business practices but also sound science to succeed? And how do you deal with the impact of globalized competition, a fluctuating world economy, and growing pressure from environmental groups and government regulators? Revised and updated throughout, Strategic Management for the Plastics Industry: Dealing with Globalization and Sustainability, Second Edition continues to combine coverage of management best practices with coverage of issues specific to the plastics industry. The author outlines the fundamentals of polymer manufacturing, compounding, distribution, processing, and auxiliary products that make this industry unique, and shows how these factors affect management decisions. Using case studies and examples, he demonstrates the thinking behind successful managerial choices and illustrates what errors to avoid. The book also explains the interrelationships between technologies, markets, business sectors, and strategies in the plastics industry. Topics include company culture, staffing, how to manage internal growth, the "dos and don’ts" of acquisitions, and much more. The material is based on the author’s more than 55 years of experience, extensive research, and interviews with managers throughout the industry. What’s New in This Edition A new chapter on globalization and sustainability All chapters revised and updated Updated case studies, and one new case study The book is written for a broad audience, including aspiring professionals who wish to become managers, managers who want to round out their skills, consultants to the industry, and university students and faculty in plastics engineering and polymer chemistry departments. The combination of experience-based insights and research-based strategies make this an essential resource to help you operate productively, manage effectively, and grow in the global marketplace.

Monetary Policy and the Oil Market (ADB Institute Series on Development Economics) by Naoyuki Yoshino
English | 6 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 4431557962 | 164 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.1 MB

While oil price fluctuations in the past can be explained by pure supply factors, this book argues that it is monetary policy that plays a significant role in setting global oil prices. It is a key factor often neglected in much of the earlier literature on the determinants of asset prices, including oil prices. However, this book presents a framework for modeling oil prices while incorporating monetary policy. It also provides a complete theoretical basis of the determinants of crude oil prices and the transmission channels of oil shocks to the economy. Moreover, using several up-to-date surveys and examples from the real world, this book gives insight into the empirical side of energy economics. The empirical studies offer explanations for the impact of monetary policy on crude oil prices in different periods including during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008–2009, the impact of oil price variations on developed and emerging economies, the effectiveness of monetary policy in the Japanese economy incorporating energy prices, and the macroeconomic impacts of oil price movements in trade-linked cases. This must-know information on energy economics is presented in a reader-friendly format without being overloaded with excessive and complicated calculations.

The ManuFuture Road: Towards Competitive and Sustainable High-Adding-Value Manufacturing by Francesco Jovane
English | 22 Oct. 2008 | ISBN: 3540770119 | 274Pages | PDF | 10 MB

Manufacturing in Europe is under great pressure from structural changes in the global economy. The high technical, social and cultural standards in Europe mean that our manufacturing enterprises lead the world but inevitably production and consumption continues to migrate to regions that allow higher profitability from lower costs of production with the promise of new markets. Structural changes in European industries will influence employment and welfare.

Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: World Capitalism and Global History by Hartmut Elsenhans
English | 2014 | ISBN: 935150056X | 340 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Capitalism is often recognised as a realisation of the bourgeois revolution—war to the castles and peace to the huts.

This book argues that a lack in perception of the progressive aspects of capitalism has resulted in policy measures that have frequently been defeated. It brings out the importance of capitalism as the promise of being able to attain socialism. Based on modern economics of a post-Keynesian nature, it rejects mechanistic Marxism and the civilisational process of cultural turn thinking.

The book is a comprehensive analysis of the origins of capitalism, its contradictions, the dynamics of non-capitalist societies and the challenges of globalisation (including theories of imperialism).

The Merchant Republics: Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Hamburg, 1648-1790 by Mary Lindemann
English | 2014 | ISBN: 1107074436 | 371 pages | PDF | 4 MB

The Merchant Republics analyzes the ways in which three major economic powerhouses - Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Hamburg - developed dual identities as "communities of commerce" and as republics over the course of the long eighteenth century (c. 1648-1790). In addition to discussing the qualities that made these three cities alike, this volume also considers the very real differences that derived from their dissimilar histories, political structures, economic fates, and cultural expectations. While all valued both their republicanism and their merchant identities, each presented a different face to the world and each made the transition from an early modern republic to a modern city in a different manner.

The Great Divergence Reconsidered: Europe, India, and the Rise to Global Economic Power by Roman Studer
English | 2015 | ISBN: 1107020549 | 238 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Contrary to popular narratives, Market Integration in Europe and India shows that Europe's rise to its current status as an undisputed world economic leader was not the effect of the Industrial Revolution, nor can it be explained by coal or colonial exploitation. Using a wealth of new historical evidence stretching from the seventeenth to the twentieth century, Roman Studer shows that the Great Divergence occurred in the seventeenth century, if not earlier. When compared to India and other parts of the Asiatic world, early modern Europe was characterized by a more powerful transportation system, bigger trade flows, larger and better integrated markets, higher productivity levels, and superior living standards, even before the Industrial Revolution brought about far-reaching structural changes and made Europe's supremacy even more pronounced. Thus, an interplay of various factors best explains Europe's early and gradual rise, including better institutions, favorable geographical features, increasing political stability, and increasingly rapid advances in science and technology.

English | ISBN: 0199640998, 0199677417 | 2012 | 352 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Constructing Identity in and around Organizations is the second volume in Perspectives on Process Organization Studies, a series which explores an emerging approach to the study of organizations that focuses on (understanding) activities, interactions, and change as essential properties of organizations rather than structures and state - an approach which prioritizes activity over product, change over persistence, novelty over continuity, and expression over determination. The constructing of identities - those processes through which actors in and around organizations claim, accept, negotiate, affirm, stabilize, maintain, reproduce, challenge, disrupt, destabilize, repair or otherwise relate to their sense of selves and others - has become a critically important topic in the study of organizations. This volume attempts to amplify - and possibly refract - contemporary debates amongst identity scholars that question established notions of identity as "essence", "entity," or "thing". It calls for alternative approaches to understanding identity and its significance in contexts in and around organizations by conceptualizing it as "process" - that is, being continually under construction. Based in diverse theoretical and philosophical traditions and contexts, contributions by leading scholars to this volume offer new perspectives on how individual and organizational identities evolve and come to be constructed through ongoing activities and interactions.

Jean-François Gayraud, "Le nouveau capitalisme criminel" 
French | ISBN: 2738130720 | 2014 | 190 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Financiarisé, mondialisé et dérégulé à l'excès, le capitalisme n'est-il pas devenu criminogène, tant il offre désormais d'opportunités et d'incitations aux déviances frauduleuses ? C'est ce qu'indique la dimension criminelle qu'ont prise certaines crises financières, au Japon, en Albanie, en Espagne ou encore au Mexique et en Colombie. C'est ce qu'implique l'extension du trading de haute fréquence, qui permet de négocier à la nanoseconde des milliers d'ordres de Bourse. Et c'est enfin ce qu'induit le blanchiment d'argent sale à travers
les narcobanques. Éclairant toujours plus profondément la géoéconomie
et la géopolitique du crime organisé,
Jean-François Gayraud montre ici que, sur les marchés financiers, le crime est parfois si systématique qu'il en devient systémique dans ses effets. De curieuses coopérations et hybridations
se nouent ainsi entre criminels en col blanc, gangsters traditionnels et hommes politiques corrompus.
Il s'interroge aussi sur le devenir de la finance : portée par sa seule volonté de puissance, par delà
le bien et le mal, n'est-elle pas en train de s'affranchir de la souveraineté des États ? Dès lors, face à des puissances financières aux arcanes si sombres, quelle liberté reste-t-il ?

505 <--> Gülen: The Ambiguous Politics of Market Islam in Turkey and the World
http://nitroflare.com/view/51046A9DAC4B9BC/0814770983.pdf
https://filejoker.net/giktbmlt18rl


Joshua D. Hendrick, "Gülen: The Ambiguous Politics of Market Islam in Turkey and the World" 
English | ISBN: 0814770983, 1479800465 | 2013 | 211 pages | PDF True | 2 MB

The "Hizmet" ("Service") Movement of Fethullah Gülen is Turkey’s most influential Islamic identity community. Widely praised throughout the early 2000s as a mild and moderate variation on Islamic political identity, the Gülen Movement has long been a topic of both adulation and conspiracy in Turkey. In Gülen, Joshua D. Hendrick suggests that the Gülen Movement should be given credit for playing a significant role in Turkey's rise to global prominence.

Hendrick draws on 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Turkey and the U.S. for his study. He argues that the movement’s growth and impact both inside and outside Turkey position both its leader and its followers as indicative of a "post political" turn in twenty-first century Islamic political identity in general, and as illustrative of Turkey’s political, economic, and cultural transformation in particular.

The Great Financial Meltdown: Systemic, Conjunctural or Policy-Created? (New Directions in Modern Economics series) by Turan Subasat
English | 2016 | ISBN: 1784716480 | 384 pages | PDF | 6 MB

The Great Financial Meltdown reviews, advocates and critiques the systemic, conjunctural and policy-based explanations for the 2008 crisis. The book expertly examines the explanations for the global crisis to assess their analytical and empirical validity. Comprehensive yet accessible chapters, written by a collection of prominent authors, cover a wide range of political economy approaches to the crisis, including Marxian, Post Keynesian and other heterodox schools.

This interrogation of economic policy in light of the financial crisis is essential reading for real-word economists. To those seeking to understand the current economic stagnation and failings of the system, it offers an enlightening exposition of contemporary political economy.

Contributors include: E. Bakir, R. Bellofiore, A. Campbell, R. Desai, B. Fine, D. Fouskas, A. Freeman, D. Harvey, A. Kaltenbrunner, E. Karacimen, D. Kotz, S. Mavroudeas, S. Mohun, O. Orhangazi, M. Roberts, T. Subasat, J. Toporowski, J. Weeks

Create Your Own Economy: The Path to Prosperity in a Disordered World
Audio CDs in MP3 / English: MP3, 192 kb/s (2 ch) | Duration: 07:38:27 | 2009 | ISBN-10: 140016219X | 629 MB
Genre: Economy

How will we live well in a super-networked, information-soaked, yet predictably irrational world? The only way to know is to understand how the way we think is changing. As economist Tyler Cowen boldly shows in Create Your Own Economy, the way we think now is changing more rapidly than it has in a very long time. Not since the Industrial Revolution has a man-made creation-in this case, the World Wide Web-so greatly influenced the way our minds work and our human potential. Cowen argues brilliantly that we are breaking down cultural information into ever-smaller tidbits, ordering and reordering them in our minds (and our computers) to meet our own specific needs. Create Your Own Economy explains why the coming world of Web 3.0 is good for us; why social networking sites such as Facebook are so necessary; what's so great about "Tweeting" and texting; how education will get better; and why politics, literature, and philosophy will become richer. This is a revolutionary guide to life in the new world.

Tyler Cowen (Author), Patrick Lawlor (Narrator)

Klaus Watzka, "Ziele formulieren: Erfolgsvoraussetzungen wirksamer Zielvereinbarungen" 
2016 | German | ISBN-10: 3658122730 | 72 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Dieser Leitfaden bietet Führungskräften eine kompakte Handlungshilfe für wirksame Zielvereinbarungen. Er geht dabei auch ausführlich auf wichtige psychologische Grundlagen ein. Mitarbeiterführung über Ziele ist mittlerweile ein weit verbreiteter Führungsansatz. Damit dieser in der Organisation die gewünschte Wirksamkeit entfaltet, gilt es hinsichtlich der Zielinhalte und Zielformulierungen viele Voraussetzungen zu beachten. Gerade Managementsysteme, die auf den ersten Blick verständlich und plausibel erscheinen, sind auf den zweiten Blick dann doch viel komplexer, werfen beim konkreten Einsatz eine Reihe von Fragen auf und führen in der Unternehmenspraxis immer wieder zu Handhabungsfehlern. Für die „Führung über Ziele“ als anspruchsvolles Managementinstrument gilt das in hohem Maße.

Schuster beweist, dass sowohl die funktionale als auch die hedonistische Interaktion zwischen Kunde und Marke in sozialen Netzwerken einen signifikant positiven Effekt auf die emotionale Markenbindung besitzt. Weiterhin bestätigen seine Forschungsergebnisse die Hypothese, dass die Interaktionshäufigkeit die emotionale Markenbindung im zeitlichen Verlauf positiv beeinflusst. Mit dieser Arbeit liegt im deutschsprachigen Raum erstmals eine Studie vor, welche Aufschluss über den Ursache-Wirkungs-Zusammenhang zwischen Interaktion, Markenbindung und dem Kundenverhalten in Social Network Brand Communities gibt.

Deutsch | 28. Sep. 2010 | ISBN: 3834926388 | 331 Seiten | PDF | 1 MB

Unternehmenszusammenbrüche, die oft mit fragwürdigen, teils kriminellen Bilanzierungsmethoden einhergingen, führten auch zu Kritik an Wirtschaftsprüfern. Hierauf reagierten die Gesetzgeber mit zahlreichen Reformen. Christopher Zilch untersucht, ob strengere Regulierungen zu einer Verbesserung der Prüfungsqualität führen müssen.

Roman Becker, Gregor Daschmann, "Das Fan-Prinzip: Mit emotionaler Kundenbindung Unternehmen erfolgreich steuern" 
2016 | Auflage: 2 | German | ISBN-10: 3658122021 | 223 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Wie Sie Ihre Kunden zu leidenschaftlichen Unternehmensfans machen, zeigen Roman Becker und Gregor Daschmann eindrucksvoll in diesem Buch. Denn im Gegensatz zu zufriedenen Kunden sind Fan-Kunden emotional an Ihr Unternehmen gebunden und tragen maßgeblich zum nachhaltigen wirtschaftlichen Erfolg bei – sowohl als direkte Käufer als auch als aktive Botschafter. Die Autoren erläutern, warum ein komplettes Umdenken im Kundenbeziehungsmanagement und eine Abkehr von den gewohnten Steuerungsgrößen erforderlich sind und warum Kundenzufriedenheit alleine nicht mehr ausreicht. Basierend auf Interviews mit mehr als 100.000 Kunden vermitteln sie direkt nachvollziehbar, was Fan-Kunden ausmacht, warum sie so viel wert sind, wie man emotionale Kundenbindung messen kann – und vor allem: wie man sie steuert und steigert! Ein Muss für alle Wirtschaftsentscheider, die ihr Unternehmen noch erfolgreicher machen wollen.

Future Viability, Business Models and Values: Strategy, Business Management and Economy in Disruptive Markets
Springer | Business & Management | Jul 4 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319340298 | 116 pages | pdf | 2.37 mb

Authors: Glauner, Friedrich
Analyzes the core driving forces that are transforming global markets
Presents central paradigms of viable future business models and corporate strategies
Introduces best practice cases for business models that establish value-added resource cy

This book challenges the traditional models of modern economy, business education and management, which are devoted to the concepts of scarcity, competition, growth and yield. It deconstructs the spiral of acceleration in which technological shifts concerning global markets and enterprises produce a dynamic of unbridled disruption, concentration and erosion of human and natural resources. The book analyzes how, in the face of this dynamic, once successful business models increasingly lead to existential jeopardy.The book embeds its argument in the impact of technological change on strategy in general. It subsequently analyzes the degree of rationality in the strategy building process to juxtapose revenue and responsibility as the fundamental principles of diverging strategic concepts. In its central chapters the book explores the benefits of consciousness-driven business models and value-added strategies for the awareness markets of the future and their impact on team excellence and resource handling. It develops an understanding of how corporations can function as ecosystems – fostering the growth and development of the resources they operate on, rather than being based on their exploitation. Understanding this structure of viable future business models is the overall theme of this pioneering book.
“This book endeavors to set out yet another paradigm for a viable economics, the paradigm of ethicology. It seeks to replace the concepts of competition, scarcity and growth with strategies and business models based on resource creation, added values cycles, enrichment and symbiosis in line with the awareness economy it describes.” Hunter Lovins,President and Founder of Natural Capitalism Solutions
“… a very basic paradigm shift in our future strategies …”
Henner Klein, Chairman Emeritus A.T. Kearney
“The book stands right on the tectonic fault line between our old and our new reality. It manages to do both: analyze the shifting paradigms and provoke new thinking.”
Dr. Martin R. Stuchtey, Director of the McKinsey Center for Business & Environment
“This book is raising the bar. His vision dares to rethink the principles of the liberal and social market economy in a globalized business world.”
Prof. Dr. René Schmidpeter, CBS Köln
“A book worth reading and reflecting on. Onwards to an economy that works for 100% of humanity.” Michael Pirson,Associate Professor, Director Center for Humanistic Management, Fordham University and Research Fellow, Harvard University
„ … powerful arguments and practical guidance on how companies can become sustainable and live up to the realities of global enterprise …”

Theoretical And Empirical Studies On Cooperatives: Lessons For Cooperatives In South Africa
Springer | Geography | July 31, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319342150 | 106 pages | pdf | 1.51 mb

Editors: Okem, Andrew Emmanuel (Ed.)
Outlines how cooperatives can be used as a tool for development and reconciliation in post-conflict contexts
Provokes debate around interdisciplinary perspectives on cooperatives
Contributes to the body of knowledge about cooperatives in Africa

The book outlines how cooperatives can be used as a tool for development and reconciliation in post-conflict contexts. This book also examines the successes and challenges for emerging and existing cooperatives in Africa, while delivering both practical lessons and insights into the theory. It presents completely new materials on the cooperative movement, against a backdrop of increasing global recognition of the roles of cooperatives and collective action in socio-economic development. Readers are invited to consider how, as an economic model that seeks to advance member collective interests, cooperatives are invaluable tools for human, economic and social development. Social and human geographers find this a remarkably impactful contribution to the literature surrounding cooperatives in Africa and cooperative theory in general. Policy experts and students also find the research informative and insightful.

Ed Conway, "The Summit: Bretton Woods, 1944: J. M. Keynes and the Reshaping of the Global Economy"
ISBN: 160598681X, 1605989657 | 2015 | EPUB | 480 pages | 4 MB

A brilliant narrative history of the most colorful and important economic summit in history―held during the height of World War II.
The idea of world leaders gathering in the midst of economic crisis has become all too familiar. But the meeting at Bretton Woods in 1944 was different. It was the only time countries from around the world have agreed to overhaul the structure of the international monetary system. Against all odds, they were successful. The system they set up presided over the longest, strongest and most stable period of growth the world economy has ever seen. Its demise some decades later was at least partly responsible for the periodic economic crises that culminated in the financial collapse of the 2000s.

But what everyone has always assumed to be a dry economic conference was in fact replete with drama. The delegates spent half the time at each other's throats and the other half drinking in the hotel bar. The Russians nearly capsized the entire project. The French threatened to walk out, repeatedly. All the while war in Europe raged on.

At the very heart of the conference was the love-hate relationship between the Briton John Maynard Keynes, the greatest economist of his day, who suffered a heart attack at the conference itself and who was a true worldwide celebrity - and his American counterpart Harry Dexter White (later revealed to be passing information secretly to Russian spies). Both were intent on creating an economic settlement which would put right the wrongs of Versailles. Both were working to prevent another world war. But they were also working to defend their countries' national interests.

Drawing on a wealth of unpublished accounts, diaries and oral histories, this brilliant book describes the conference in stunning color and clarity. Bringing to life the characters, events and economics and written with exceptional verve and narrative pace, this is an extraordinary debut from a talented new historian. 16 pages of B&W photographs

Stefan R. Grabs zeigt, dass die Verlässlichkeit insbesondere von subjektiven Anhangangaben im IFRS-Abschluss begrenzt ist und insbesondere die Abschlussprüfung in diesem Fall nur eingeschränkt zu einer Erhöhung beitragen kann. Der Autor betrachtet zunächst die theoretischen, normativen und empirischen Perspektiven des Anhangs sowie der Abschlussprüfung mit dem Schwerpunkt auf dem Konzept der hinreichenden Prüfungssicherheit. Im Rahmen einer eigenen empirischen Untersuchung werden die Determinanten der maximalen Prüfungssicherheit von Anhangangaben aufgezeigt und dabei auch die Wirkung des Offenlegungsortes (Anhang oder Bilanz/Gesamtergebnisrechnung) analysiert.

Im Zentrum dieser Arbeit steht die Entwicklung eines Modellrahmens für ein Kreditportfolio, welcher die Abhängigkeiten zwischen Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit, Verlustrate und Forderungshöhe bei Ausfall mittels Faktoren bzw. Copulae vollständig erfasst. Im Gegensatz zur bestehenden Literatur wird dabei die Verlustrate differenziert dargestellt und die Forderungshöhe in die Abhängigkeitsstruktur integriert. Da empirische Evidenz für Abhängigkeiten zwischen den Risikoparametern vorliegt und Verlustrate und Forderungshöhe nur bei Ausfall beobachtbar sind, wird eine Erweiterung des Schätzers aus Heckmans Selektionsmodell (1979) vorgeschlagen. Zudem wird der Einfluss der Abhängigkeitsstruktur auf die Verlustverteilung eines Portfolios untersucht.

Katharina Kern untersucht die Nutzung des sozialen Netzwerkes Facebook in der Eventkommunikation von Marathonläufen in der D-A-CH-Region. Sie leitet daraus Handlungsempfehlungen ab, die es den Veranstaltern in Zukunft ermöglichen sollen, Facebook zielgerichteter und damit effizienter und erfolgreicher einzusetzen. Die Veranstalter von Marathonläufen treiben den Ausbau ihrer Social-Media-Präsenzen stetig voran und versuchen sich damit einen Wettbewerbsvorteil gegenüber der Konkurrenz zu schaffen. Der Einsatz sozialer Medien in der Eventkommunikation bietet den Veranstaltern eine Vielzahl neuer Möglichkeiten und Chancen ihre Events bekannter zu machen, den eigenen Zielgruppen näher zu kommen und die Verbindung zu ihnen zu stärken.

Jeremy Seabrook, "Cut Out: Living Without Welfare (Left Book Club)"
ISBN: 074533623X, 0745336183 | 2016 | PDF | 224 pages | 2 MB

From the ale-house drunks of the Victorian era to the obese benefit scroungers of today, civilization has consistently pinned blame and shame for any societal issues on the poorer classes. 

In reality, the recent dismantling of crucial welfare state sections by both the U.K.’s Labour and Conservative governments has resulted in the emergence of a new, harshly disadvantaged layer of British society. Growing numbers of unemployed citizens have been deserted, their voices obscured. 

In Cut Out, journalist Jeremy Seabrook talks to these silenced communities in order to expose the cruel realities of the situation the British government has created for some of its most vulnerable citizens. Seabrook uncovers the many routes to poverty caused by welfare reforms and explores the brutally honest stories of Britain’s most devastated lives.

Guide OCDE sur le devoir de diligence pour des chaînes d'approvisionnement responsables en minerais provenant de zones de conflit ou à haut risque : Troisième édition by Oecd Organisation For Economic Co-Operation And Development
French | 2 May 2016 | ISBN: 9264253513 | 140 Pages | PDF (True) | 1.56 MB

Le secteur des minerais offre de belles perspectives économiques. Il génère des revenus, crée de l'emploi et nourrit le développement local. Malheureusement, une bonne part des exploitations minières se situent dans des zones de conflit ou à haut risque, et sont souvent impliquées, directement ou indirectement, dans des conflits armés ou des violations de droits humains, entravant le progrès social et la croissance économique. Le Guide Ocde sur le devoir de diligence pour des chaînes d'approvisionnement responsables en minerais provenant de zones de conflit adresse aux entreprises du secteur des minerais des recommandations pratiques, visées par les pouvoirs publics, pour les aider à adopter des pratiques responsables, à respecter les droits humains et à rompre tout lien avec d'éventuels conflits. Le Guide Ocde sur les minerais concerne toute entreprise susceptible d'exploiter tout type de minerais ou de métaux dans des zones de conflit ou à haut risque, et a pour objectif d'améliorer la transparence des chaînes d'approvisionnement et d'assurer un engagement durable des entreprises dans le secteur des minerais.

Projet OCDE/G20 sur l'érosion de la base d'imposition et le transfert de bénéfices Règles de communication obligatoire d'informations, Action 12 - Rapport final 2015 by Oecd Organisation For Economic Co-Operation And Development
French | 2 May 2016 | ISBN: 9264252398 | 108 Pages | PDF (True) | 1.87 MB

À ce jour, l'une des principales difficultés rencontrées par les administrations fiscales à travers le monde est l'absence d'accès en temps voulu à des informations complètes et pertinentes sur les stratégies de planification fiscale agressive. Les régimes de communication obligatoire d'informations peuvent permettre aux pays de réagir rapidement face aux risques fiscaux en offrant un accès en temps opportun à de telles informations. Ce rapport passe en revue les régimes de communication obligatoire d'informations à partir de l'expérience de pays qui en sont dotés, et formule des recommandations en vue d'établir un cadre modulaire à l'intention des pays qui souhaitent mettre en oeuvre un régime de communication obligatoire d'informations permettant d'obtenir très tôt des renseignements sur les stratégies de planification fiscale à caractère potentiellement agressif ou abusif et sur leurs utilisateurs. Les recommandations offrent la latitude nécessaire pour trouver un juste équilibre entre la nécessité pour l'administration fiscale d'obtenir, en temps utile, des renseignements de meilleure qualité et les contraintes de respect des règles pour les contribuables. Le rapport énonce en outre des recommandations spécifiques portant sur les règles qui ciblent les dispositifs fiscaux internationaux et visant à concevoir et mettre en place une coopération et des échanges de renseignements plus efficaces entre administrations fiscales.

The effective use of school resources is a policy priority across Oecd countries. The Oecd Reviews of School Resources explore how resources can be governed, distributed, utilised and managed to improve the quality, equity and efficiency of school education.
The series considers four types of resources: financial resources, such as public funding of individual schools; human resources, such as teachers, school leaders and education administrators; physical resources, such as location, buildings and equipment; and other resources, such as learning time.
This series offers timely policy advice to both governments and the education community. It includes both country reports and thematic studies.

William Nordhaus, "The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World" 
English | ISBN: 030018977X | 2014 | 320 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Climate change is profoundly altering our world in ways that pose major risks to human societies and natural systems. We have entered the Climate Casino and are rolling the global-warming dice, warns economist William Nordhaus. But there is still time to turn around and walk back out of the casino, and in this essential book the author explains how. Bringing together all the important issues surrounding the climate debate, Nordhaus describes the science, economics and politics involved - and the steps necessary to reduce the perils of global warming. Using language accessible to any concerned citizen and taking care to present different points of view fairly, he discusses the problem from start to finish: from the beginning, where warming originates in our personal energy use, to the end, where societies employ regulations or taxes or subsidies to slow the emissions of gases responsible for climate change. Nordhaus offers a new analysis of why earlier policies, such as the Kyoto Protocol, failed to slow carbon dioxide emissions, how new approaches can succeed, and which policy tools will most effectively reduce emissions. In short, he clarifies a defining problem of our times and lays out the next critical steps for slowing the trajectory of global warming.

The Art of People: 11 Simple People Skills That Will Get You Everything You Want By Dave Kerpen
2016 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0553419404 | EPUB | 6 MB


What does it take to win success and influence? Some people think that in today s hyper-competitive world, it s the tough, take-no-prisoners type who comes out on top. But in reality, argues New York Times bestselling author Dave Kerpen, it s actually those with the best "people skills" who win the day. Those who build the right relationships. Those who truly understand and connect with their colleagues, their customers, their partners. Those who can teach, lead, and inspire. In a world where we are constantly connected, and social media has become the primary way we communicate, the key to getting ahead is being the person others like, respect, and trust. Because no matter who you are or what profession you're in, success is contingent less on what you can do for yourself, but on "what other people are willing to do for" you. Here, through 53 bite-sized, easy-to-execute, and often counterintuitive tips, you ll learn to master the 11 People Skills that will get you more of what you want at work, at home, and in life. For example, you ll learn: . The single most important question you can ever ask to win attention in a meeting . The one simple key to networking that nobody talks about . How to remain top of mind for thousands of people, everyday . Why it usually pays to be the one to give the bad news . How to blow off the right people . And why, when in doubt, buy him a Bonsai A book best described as "How to Win Friends and Influence People" for today s world, The Art of People shows how to charm and win over anyone to be more successful at work and outside of it."

Realistic Simulation of Financial Markets: Analyzing Market Behaviors by the Third Mode of Science
Springer | Economics | August 7, 2016 | ISBN-10: 4431550569 | 197 pages | pdf | 7.42 mb

Editors: Kita, Hajime, Taniguchi, Kazuhisa, Nakajima, Yoshihiro (Eds.)
Presents the ultra-realistic artificial market simulator U-Mart that can simulate “arrowhead” in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other markets
Draws on more than 10 years of academic experiments to create a unique educational tool
Introduces a new approach for interdisciplinary research bringing together economics and engineering

This book takes up unique agent-based approaches to solving problems related to stock and their derivative markets. Toward this end, the authors have worked for more than 15 years on the development of an artificial market simulator called U-Mart for use as a research and educational tool. A noteworthy feature of the U-Mart simulator compared to other artificial market simulators is that U-Mart is an ultra-realistic artificial stock and their derivative market simulator. For example, it can simulate “arrowhead,” a next-generation trading system used in the Tokyo Stock Exchange and other major markets, as it takes into consideration the institutional design of the entire market. Another interesting feature of the U-Mart simulator is that it permits both human and computer programs to participate simultaneously as traders in the artificial market. In this book, first the details of U-Mart are explained, enabling readers to install and run the simulator on their computers for research and educational purposes. The simulator thus can be used for gaming simulation of the artificial market and even for users as agents to implement their own trading strategies for agent-based simulation (ABS).The book also presents selected research cases using the U-Mart simulator. Here, topics include automated acquisition of trading strategy using artificial intelligence techniques, evaluation of a market maker system to treat thin markets such as those for small and regional businesses, systemic risk analysis of the financial market considering institutional design of the market, and analysis of how humans behave and learn in gaming simulation. New perspectives on artificial market research are provided, and the power, potential, and challenge of ABS are discussed. As explained in this important work, ABS is considered to be an effective tool as the third approach of social science, an alternative to traditional literary and mathematical approaches.

Udemy - Understand Banks & Financial Markets
MP4 | AVC 280kbps | English | 1280x720 | 30fps | 3 hours | AAC stereo 62kbps | 1.52 GB
Genre: Video Training

Learn about money, (central) banks and financial markets: participants, products, trading motives, pricing and structure. Starting in the '80s, banks have become huge financial supermarkets offering a wide range of different services and products. Employees in these large banks have developed specialized expertise in the area in which they decide to make a career. Along with rapid developments in information technology this has resulted in large IT departments staffed by people without any particular financial and banking education.

For example: How was it possible that the 1929 financial crisis was repeated by the 2008 credit crisis? The outrage and confusion illustrates the knowledge gap of understanding what banks do, what happens on financial markets and what is needed to prevent a derailment of the financial sector.

Since 2005, I train people in the financial sector. To bridge the basic knowledge gap with an easy accessible tool, I have created a 3 hour video E-training at Udemy.

The topics covered by this training are for example:

Learn about money types and the role of Central Banks;
Understand the different bank types and their activities;
Get an overview of the 3 financial product categories to trade capital, foreign currencies and risk
Understand financial market products trading: how, why and by whom;
What happens on a dealing room;
You will be introduced to types of derivative products and why they are used;
Learn about the root of the 2008 financial crisis and how it can be prevented;
Understand exchange trading by a 20 minute entertaining video of the history of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.

Improve you skills to work in the finance industry
Understand financial products and the language of finance
Identify the 3 types of money and how banks create money
You will learn what different types of banks do and how they make money
Overview of the 3 financial product categories to trade capital, foreign currencies and risk
Understand the emotions that drive Risk Management
The different types of derivative products and why they are traded in high volumes
Know the root of the 2008 financial crisis and how it can be prevented
Know how, why and by whom products are traded on financial markets
What is the role of Central Banks and their influence
How money is created

Craig Scott, "Anonymous Agencies, Backstreet Businesses, and Covert Collectives: Rethinking Organizations in the 21st Century" 
2013 | ISBN-10: 0804781389 | 272 pages | PDF | 12 MB

Many of today's organizations "live in public"; they devote extensive resources to branding, catching the public eye, and capitalizing on the age of transparency. But, at the same time, a growing number of companies and other collectives are flying under the radar, concealing their identities and activities.

This book offers a framework for thinking about how organizations and their members communicate identity to relevant audiences. Considering the degree to which organizations reveal themselves, the extent to which members express their identification with the organization, and whether the audience is public or local, author Craig R. Scott describes collectives as residing in "regions" that range from transparent to shaded, from shadowed to dark. Taking a closer look at groups like EarthFirst!, the Church of Scientology, Alcoholics Anonymous, the KKK, Skull and Bones, U.S. special mission units, men's bathhouses, and various terrorist organizations, this book draws attention to shaded, shadowed, and dark collectives as important organizations in the contemporary landscape.

An Introduction to the Theory of Mechanism Design By Tilman Borgers
2015 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 019973402X | PDF | 1 MB


What is the best way of auctioning an asset? How should a group of people organize themselves to ensure the best provision of public goods? How should exchanges be organized? In An Introduction to the Theory of Mechanism Design, Tilman Börgers addresses these questions and more through an exploration of the economic theory of mechanism design, also known as reverse game theory. Game theory takes the rules of the game as a given and makes predictions about the behavior of strategic players, but the theory of mechanism design goes a step further to select the optimal rules of the game. A relatively new economic theory, mechanism design studies the instrument itself rather than the results of the instrument. An Introduction to the Theory of Mechanism Design provides rigorous but accessible explanations of classic results in the theory of mechanism design, such as Myerson's theorem on expected revenue maximizing auctions, Myerson and Satterthwaite's theorem on the impossibility of ex post efficient bilateral trade with asymmetric information, and Gibbard and Satterthwaite's theorem on the non-existence of dominant strategy voting mechanisms. Börgers also provides an examination of the frontiers of current research in the area with an original and unified perspective that will appeal to advanced students of economics.

China's Economy What Everyone Needs to Know By Arthur R. Kroeber
2016 | 336 Pages | ISBN: 0190239034 , 0190239026 | PDF | 14 MB


China is on track to exceed the United States as the world's largest economy in the next several years. It is already the leading global trading nation. Even though its growth rate has recently slowed from years past, China has had the fastest yearly growth rate of any country for much of the last three decades. In China's Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know, Arthur Kroeber offers an overview of the highlights of China's development since economic reforms were initiated under Deng Xiaoping in 1979. He argues that manufacturing, agricultural change, and construction reoriented the economy in the 1980s and 1990s through state-owned enterprises, private entrepreneurship, and foreign investment. Those shifts unleashed perhaps the largest migration ever in world history from rural areas to urban centers, accompanied by a no less unprecedented expansion of infrastructure. Changes in the country's fiscal and financial systems vastly increased China's monetary holdings from the 1990s onwards, leading to the country's strategic holding of more U.S. debt than any other nation. Kroeber also examines economic growth as it has been experienced by Chinese workers and consumers, including the mounting problems of income and wealth inequality, corruption, and environmental degradation. Kroeber ultimately turns to the consequences of Chinese economic growth: its decisive impact on the world economy, its visible and challenging resource extraction from Africa and Latin America, and its increasing engagement with global economic institutions.

Survival under Uncertainty: An Introduction to Probability Models of Social Structure and Evolution
Springer | Physics | Jul 29 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319394193 | 296 pages | pdf | 5.11 mb

Authors: Volchenkov, Dimitri
First monographical text devoted to this subject matter
Written by a leading researcher in this emerging field
Tutorial and self-contained presentation

This book introduces and studies a number of stochastic models of subsistence, communication, social evolution and political transition that will allow the reader to grasp the role of uncertainty as a fundamental property of our irreversible world. At the same time, it aims to bring about a more interdisciplinary and quantitative approach across very diverse fields of research in the humanities and social sciences.
Through the examples treated in this work – including anthropology, demography, migration, geopolitics, management, and bioecology, among other things – evidence is gathered to show that volatile environments may change the rules of the evolutionary selection and dynamics of any social system, creating a situation of adaptive uncertainty, in particular, whenever the rate of change of the environment exceeds the rate of adaptation.
Last but not least, it is hoped that this book will contribute to the understanding that inherent randomness can also be a great opportunity – for social systems and individuals alike – to help face the challenge of “survival under uncertainty”.

Private Communities and Urban Governance: Theoretical and Comparative Perspectives
Springer | Economic Policy | August 2, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319332090 | 231 pages | pdf | 3.33 mb

Editors: Lehavi, Amnon (Ed.)
Interdisciplinary, comparative, and multi-faceted approach to the study of private communities and urban governance
Offers a major contribution for both scholarly discourse and policy design
Covers a broad scope of topics not normally covered by housing literature such as religion, culture, and security

This book offers an interdisciplinary and comparative study of the complex interplay between private versus public forms of organization and governance in urban residential developments. Bringing together top experts from numerous disciplines, including law, economics, geography, political science, sociology, and planning, this book identifies the current trends in constructing the physical, economic, and social infrastructure of residential communities across the world. It challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the division of labor between market-driven private action and public policy in regulating residential developments and the urban space, and offers a new research agenda for dealing with the future of cities in the twenty-first century. It represents a unique ongoing academic dialogue between the members of an exceptional group of scholars, underscoring the essentially of an interdisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of private communities and urban governance. As such, the book will appeal to a broad audience consisting of policy-makers, practitioners, scholars, and students across the world, especially in developing countries and transitional and emerging economies.

http://nitroflare.com/view/7594FA36A0EEA4A/085793211XInstitutions.pdf

David Howden, "Institutions in Crisis: European Perspectives on the Recession" 
English | ISBN: 085793211X | 2011 | 264 pages | PDF | 5 MB

This critical and thought-provoking book explores the causes and consequences of Europe's failed political and economic institutions. Europe's recession has created new challenges as market turmoil has shaken the foundations of the twin pillars of the new drive for European integration - political and monetary unions. This book critically assesses the patchwork solutions continually offered to hold the troubled unions together. Failed political policies, from the prodigious 'Common Agricultural Policy' to ever more common fiscal stimulus packages, are shown to have bred less than stellar results in the past, and to have devastating implications for future European growth. The contributors outline the manner through which European monetary union has subsidized and continues to exacerbate the burgeoning debt crisis. Most strikingly, the interplay between Europe's political and economic realms is exposed as the boondoggle it is, with increasingly bureaucratic institutions plaguing the continent and endangering future potential. Combining political and economic analysis, this comprehensive book will prove essential for researchers and students in international business and macroeconomics. Educated laymen wanting a keener perspective on Europe's recession will also find this book to be invaluable.

Alastair Hudson, "Equity and Trusts, 8th Edition" 
English | ISBN: 0415836883, 0415836875 | 2014 | 1428 pages | PDF | 8 MB

Alastair Hudson’s Equity and Trusts is an ideal textbook for undergraduate courses on the law of trusts and equitable remedies. It provides a clear, current and comprehensive account of the subject through which the author’s enthusiasm and expertise shine through, helping to bring to life an area of the law which students often find difficult.

Beginning with the core principles, Alastair Hudson reinforces the key points by means of clear examples throughout each chapter, helping students to build and develop their own knowledge of equity and trusts. A set of lively, discursive essays reflecting on the law then begin to outline the broader political, social and economic context of the subject and encourage the reader to begin to engage with their own critical analysis. 

The eighth edition of Equity and Trusts will be edited and updated to include discussion of the key developments in the subject since publication of the seventh edition in 2012, including the latest case law and potential for regulation relating to cohabitation and shared ownership as well as cases arising in the light of the enforcement of the Charities Act 2006.

The Future of Strategy: A Transformative Approach to Strategy for a World That Won't Stand Still By Johan Aurik, Martin Fabel
2015 | 240 Pages | ISBN: 0071848746 | PDF | 4 MB


Own the Future of Your Industry with a Transformational Strategy Designed for Today's Business World Leaders today are inundated with strategic opportunities, besieged by business disruptions, andpressured to innovate--to do things better, faster, or differently. The CEO of a Fortune 500 firm explains it best: "I am looking at 23 different strategic initiatives. Trying to develop and implement so many strategies is like trying to change the driver, tires, the oil, and the bumpers; paint the body; and tune the engine. And doing all of this on a car that's running at full speed." The answer used to be found in strategy. But in thepast decade, the commonly deployed large-scale strategic exercises were largely discredited. They were slow and elaborate and did not deliver the expected returns, let alone help make sense of a glut of initiatives or cope with an increasingly unpredictable future. The Future of Strategy brings strategy back fromthose big top-down plans. It answers the questions of executives facing tumultuous business conditions and rapidly shifting markets: Is strategy still possible? Yes. Aren't strategies outdated before they can be implemented? Not if they are done right. Rather than developing strategy, aren't we better off being agile and able to capitalize on emerging trends faster than our peers? Agility complements strategy; it cannot replace it. This book is about reversing course and repositioningstrategy in its rightful place as the overarchingmanagement system. The authors introduce their core methodology, designed to future proof companies against the friction and "fog of war" that inexorably accompany changing times. They synthesize three fundamental principles that, when combined, provide the means to reclaim strategy: Take direct cues from fundamental trends affecting the company going forward Engage people across the company to translate these cues into strategy and effectively eliminate the handover hurdle between formulation and execution, a major reason for strategy failure Capture the output as competitive opportunities and manage their life cycles--when some have run their course, others are ready to take over Strategy today requires stepping over the shadows of one's own ingrained beliefs to capture new opportunities.This book reveals the inner workings of transformational strategies developed by leaders who gradually become more successful by advancing winning combinations of attitudes, values, habits, and practices.

Zukunftsfähige Geschäftsmodelle und Werte: Strategieentwicklung und Unternehmensführung in disruptiven Märkten by Friedrich Glauner
German | 7 Aug. 2016 | ISBN: 3662492415 | 172 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.53 MB

Im Buch wird beschrieben, wie und nach welchen Kriterien der Aufbau zukunftsfähiger Geschäftsmodelle erfolgen kann. Der Weg zu den Wettbewerbsvorteilen von morgen erfordert die Entwicklung von Geschäftsmodellen, die die zentrale Ressource der Zukunft erschließen: »Bewusstsein«. Das Erkennen von Bewusstseinsressourcen mündet in eine Bewusstseinsökonomie, die den Rahmen der Märkte von morgen definiert. In ihnen sind jene Unternehmen erfolgreich, deren Geschäftsmodelle auf einer substantiellen Nutzenstiftung basieren, die im Kern ressourcenschöpfend ist. In ihrer Gesamtbilanz führen sie zu Ressourcenwachstum und nicht, wie heute üblich, zu ihrer irreversiblen Vernichtung. Analog zu Ökosystemen, die die eigene Ressourcenbasis kontinuierlich verbreitern und vertiefen, begründen ressourcenschöpfende Geschäftsmodelle Mehrwertkreisläufe, die das Unternehmen auch bei disruptiven Marktentwicklungen bestehen lassen.

English | June 30, 2010 | ISBN: 9715618707 | 428 Pages | PDF | 3 MB

In the transitional economies of Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam (the CLV countries), foreign currencies such as the US dollar commonly circulate in addtion to the local currency. National authorities must consider the costs and benefits of such a system, especially in relation to monetary and exchange policies' effect on their development priorities.

Ran Spiegler, "Bounded Rationality and Industrial Organization" 
2014 | ISBN-10: 0199334269, 0195398718 | 240 pages | EPUB | 5 MB

Conventional economic theory assumes that consumers are fully rational, that they have well-defined preferences and easily understand the market environment. Yet, in fact, consumers may have inconsistent, context-dependent preferences or simply not enough brain-power to evaluate and compare complicated products. Thus the standard model of consumer behavior-which depends on an ideal market in which consumers are boundlessly rational-is called into question. While behavioral economists have for some time confirmed and characterized these inconsistencies, the logical next step is to examine the implications they have in markets.

Grounded in key observations in consumer psychology, Bounded Rationality and Industrial Organization develops non-standard models of "boundedly rational" consumer behavior and embeds them into familiar models of markets. It then rigorously analyses each model in the tradition of microeconomic theory, leading to a richer, more realistic picture of consumer behavior. Ran Spiegler analyses phenomena such as exploitative price plans in the credit market, complexity of financial products and other obfuscation practices, consumer antagonism to unexpected price increases, and the role of default options in consumer decision making. Spiegler unifies the relevant literature into three main strands: limited ability to anticipate and control future choices, limited ability to understand complex market environments, and sensitivity to reference points. 

Although the challenge of enriching the psychology of decision makers in economic models has been at the frontier of theoretical research in the last decade, there has been no graduate-level, theory-oriented textbook to cover developments in the last 10-15 years. Thus, Bounded Rationality and Industrial Organization offers a welcome and crucial new understanding of market behavior-it challenges conventional wisdom in ways that are interesting and economically significant, and which in the end effect the well-being of all market participants.

Galit Shmueli, "Practical Time Series Forecasting: A Hands-On Guide (2nd Edition)" 
2012 | ISBN-10: 1468053450 | 202 pages | EPUB | 5 MB

Practical Time Series Forecasting is a hands-on introduction to quantitative forecasting of time series. Quantitative forecasting is an important component of decision making in a wide range of areas and across many business functions including economic forecasting, workload projections, sales forecasts, and transportation demand. Forecasting is widely used also outside of business, such as in demography and climatology. 

The book introduces readers to the most popular statistical models and data mining algorithms used in practice. It covers issues relating to different steps of the forecasting process, from goal definition through data collection, visualization, pre-processing, modeling, performance evaluation to implementation and communication. The second edition offers a large amount of new content and improved organization. 

Practical Time Series Forecasting is suitable for courses on forecasting at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It offers clear explanations, examples, end-of-chapter problems and a case. Methods are illustrated using XLMiner, an Excel add-on. However, any software that has time series forecasting capabilities can be used with the book.

Elido Fazi - Mefistofele. Come uscire dalla crisi economica con le ricette del diavolo
Italian | UTET | 2014 | ISBN: 8851117888 | 220 pages | EPUB | 3 MB

L’Europa del futuro – un’Europa solida di fronte ai mercati finanziari, democratica, forte e solidale – non nascerà da un miracolo celeste, ma da un patto col diavolo. E che diavolo! Le ricette per uscire dalla recessione che ci attanaglia – questa la tesi del nuovo, provocatorio pamphlet dell’economista e scrittore Elido Fazi – non le custodisce infatti, e come stupirsene, un povero diavolo qualsiasi, bensì il demonio più celebre di tutta la letteratura occidentale, lo scaltro, ironico, invincibile Mefistofele, protagonista del “Faust” di Goethe. In questo capolavoro completato da Goethe negli ultimi anni di vita, citato spesso ma in realtà ben poco conosciuto (perfino dai suoi presunti lettori, come il presidente della Banca centrale tedesca Jens Weidmann, travisatore, a detta di Fazi, del suo autentico, stupefacente messaggio), è racchiusa la chiave per risolvere una volta per tutte la crisi finanziaria attuale, colpevole di un aumento della disoccupazione che sta raggiungendo livelli record, e che troppo spesso si nutre dell’ignoranza di giornalisti, politici ed economisti riguardo al vero funzionamento del sistema finanziario, all’andamento dell’economia reale e al suo rapporto con l’offerta di moneta. Come scrive Goethe a un amico, “gli scherzi molto seri” del Faust possono essere capiti probabilmente solo dai posteri.

The Gold Standard Peripheries: Monetary Policy, Adjustment and Flexibility in a Global Setting By Dr Anders Ögren, Dr Lars Fredrik Øksendal
2012 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0230343171 | PDF | 16 MB


As a world system, the gold standard knitted together minor and major countries, sophisticated and less advanced economies through their common choice of gold as monetary reference. This bookexplores the experience not of the main economic centres but of the smaller, peripheral economies of the gold standard. These peripheries differed significantly. One element, however, was common: all periphery countries were regime takers with limited influence on the regime. How did small countries adjust to an international monetary regime with seemingly little room for policy autonomy? Thisbook highlights the diversity of the gold standard experience. Each country differed reflecting different concerns, constraints and challenges. However, one common theme runs through the chapters: how central banks, representing a broad variety of peripheral experiences, were putting strong emphasis on maintaining some freedom for manoeuvre in their monetary policy. The question was how such flexibility was reached and maintained – a matterthat involved the highly relevant issues of the role of international capital markets and the management of sovereign debt by the countries involved. The book concludes with achapter on possible lessons that can be learned from the gold standard peripheries for the Euro.

The Money Trap: Escaping the Grip of Global Finance By R. Pringle
2014 | 356 Pages | ISBN: 1137366907, 0230392741 | PDF | 5 MB


Why have the efforts of governments and central banks to revive economic growth and solve the problems left by the global financial crisis met with such limited success? Why have markets been periodically paralysed by fear and uncertainty? This book argues that governments have been using the wrong policy weapons. They have relied on the traditional tools of low interest rates and monetary ease, plus tighter bank regulation and new macro-prudential toolkits. The Money Trap discusses how governments have failed to understand the roots of the rolling crisis and recession of 2007-12. It argues that these roots lie in the interaction of an elastic credit supply, dysfunctional banking systems and an unreformed international monetary system. Historically, the advanced countries enjoyed long periods of economic growth with stable money and without systemic banking crises - and minimal bank supervision. We can learn from the historical experience, and from the teaching of great economists. They point to a clear conclusion. A root-and-branch reform both of banking and of international money is required. The centrepiece of such a reform should be the re-establishment of a trusted international monetary standard. This book brings together the main strands of the current policy-oriented discussions and analyses a range of solutions, providing readers with an integrated guide and analysis to the events in the years since the start of the crisis in 2007 and their antecedents in the development of the system since the early 1970s. It draws on the author's extensive contacts and work as a leading financial commentator over the past 40 years.

Qualified people are scarce in global business. Company-assigned expatriates used to provide needed talent but this is no longer enough. Self-initiated expatriates, a new and diverse breed of internationally mobile talent, are filling the gap. Talent Management of Self-initiated Expatriates is a collection of research papers which explores who these self-initiated expatriates are and what experiences they have. It answers questions such as: how or when does one become a self-initiated expatriate (SIE)? What are SIEs' motivations and characteristics? What types or sub-types of SIEs are there? What challenges are they likely to face? How do their careers and social capital develop? What is the impact of international experience on their life overall? What are the specific experiences of sub-groups such as academics or female SIEs? As traditional talent management can no longer fulfil the needs of globally operating organisations, self-initiated expatriates have become an ever more important, albeit neglected, source of the global talent flow.

2013 | 264 Pages | ISBN: 0230378196 , 1349350958 | PDF | 1 MB


Unlock customer value by making your business age-friendly. The world's population is ageing at a rate never before seen in history. Marketing to the Ageing Consumer is the executives' guide to understanding and benefitting from this phenomenon. Fact: During the next two decades, older consumers will be the primary drivers of consumer expenditure in Europe and the US. Fact: Asia Pacific has the oldest and fastest growing population of older people. Fact: Older people have one thing in common – they are all experiencing physical ageing that determines what and how they purchase. Fact: Ageing physiology will demand changes across the spectrum of customer touchpoints for products and services of almost every marketing company. Age-marketing experts, Dick Stroud and Kim Walker, present the first and most comprehensive account of how the ageing of the consumers' minds, bodies and senses determine the products they purchase. The authors explain how ageing affects all parts of the customer experience. Their findings represent a fundamental – and surprising – shift in many paradigms of modern marketing. Full of illuminating case studies and practical tips, Marketing to the Ageing Consumer provides companies with the tools and knowledge to perform their own audit of 'age-friendliness' enabling them to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of their customers.

Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus By Jeffrey M. Perloff
2007 | 800 Pages | ISBN: 0321468589 | scanned PDF | 51 MB


Professors teaching this course have two concurrent goals: to teach the microeconomic tools students need for future coursework and careers, and to encourage students to work problems. In Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus, Perloff brings his hallmark pedagogy to the calculus-based course by integrating Solved Problems and real, data-driven applications in every chapter. This new text offers a serious presentation of calculus-based microeconomic theory and offers a suite of carefully crafted, calculus-based problem sets at the end of each chapter. Microeconomics: Theory and Applications with Calculus covers basic and modern theories first, and then offers advanced theory chapters at the end. By providing graphical representation and real-world applications to illustrate the theory, Perloff demonstrates how individuals, policy makers, and firms use microeconomic tools to analyze and resolve problems. Perloff’s algebra-based Microeconomics, now in its Fourth Edition, has become a market leader because it clearly introduces theory and helps students develop problem-solving skills through its Solved Problem feature.

Peter Wick and Volker Rabens, "Religions and Trade: Religious Formation, Transformation and Cross-Cultural Exchange Between East and West" 
English | ISBN: 9004255281 | 2014 | 396 pages | PDF | 5 MB

In Religions and Trade a number of international scholars investigate the ways in which eastern and western religions were formed and transformed from the perspective of “trade.” Trade changes religions. Religions expand through the help of trade infrastructures, and religions extend and enrich the trade relations with cultural and religious “commodities” which they contribute to the “market place” of human culture and religion. This leads to the inclusion, demarcation and densification as well as the amalgamation of religious traditions.

In an attempt to find new pathways into the world of religious dynamics, this collection of essays focuses on four elements or “commodities” of religious interchange: topologies of religious space, religious symbol systems, religious knowledge, and religious-ethical ways of life.

The outcome is a collection of chapters that apply these methods, motivated by a variety of theoretical positions. The book provides powerful and detailed analyses of the causes of income, productivity and employment variations across Europe's regions, and insights into their future prospects.

The New Frontier Investors: How Pension Funds, Sovereign Funds, and Endowments are Changing the Business of Investment Management and Long-Term Investing
Palgrave Macmillan | Finance & Banking | July 30, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137508566 | 152 pages | pdf | 3.97 mb

Authors: Singh Bachher, Jagdeep, Dixon, Adam D., Monk, Ashby H. B.

Who holds the power in financial markets? For many, the answer would probably be the large investment banks, big asset managers, and hedge funds. These are the organizations that are in the media's spotlight and whose leaders and employees command outsized salaries and bonuses. They are the supposed leading edge of global finance and their power seems almost absolute, even as questions abound about their social and economic utility. But more and more asset owners are confronting the status quo, the power to exact high fees and the focus on the short term. The New Frontier Investors chronicles the rise of this new group of long horizon asset owners that includes some of the world's largest pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments. These asset owners are driving the business of asset management to a new frontier by retaking responsibility of the end-to-end management of their investment portfolios and by re-conceptualizing investment decision-making.
The lessons illustrated in The New Frontier Investors fly in the face of conventional wisdom, which has it that these asset owners are at a disadvantage to the private sector fund managers and other service providers. These asset owners are supposedly not able to attract talent nor do they have the organizational capabilities to compete. That many are located far from the markets in which they invest only exacerbates the problem. But this is incorrect. This expanding group of asset owners is learning how to make the most of their scale and long time horizons, finding new ways to attract talent, to collaborate, and to build greater alignment with the users of capital. They are not at a disadvantage. They are at an advantage.
The New Frontier Investors is essential reading for anyone wanting to see a change in global financial markets and the professionalization of asset owners worldwide, from public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to foundations and endowments. It is thus required reading for the senior executives and employees working in the field of beneficiary institutional investment, as well as government officials and others that have a stake in the design and governance of beneficiary financial institutions and long-term capital.

Talent Management in Emerging Market Firms: Global Strategy and Local Challenges
Palgrave Macmillan UK | Management | July 31, 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137506040 | 253 pages | pdf | 4.65 mb

Authors: Latukha, Marina

Case Studies in Finance: Managing for Corporate Value Creation (7th edition) By Robert F. Bruner
2013 | 816 Pages | ISBN: 007786171X | PDF | 12 MB


Case Studies in Finance links managerial decisions to capital markets and the expectations of investors. At the core of almost all of the cases is a valuation task that requires students to look to financial markets for guidance in resolving the case problem. The focus on value helps managers understand the impact of the firm on the world around it. These cases also invite students to apply modern information technology to the analysis of managerial decisions. The cases may be taught in many different combinations. The eight-part sequence indicated by the table of contents relates to course designs used at the authors' schools. Each part of the casebook suggests a concept module, with a particular orientation.

Wellth: How I Learned to Build a Life, Not a Resume By Jason Wachob

In his first book, mindbodygreen founder Jason Wachob, redefines successful living and offers readers a new life currency to build on, one that is steeped in wellbeing...Wellth. Many of us aren t satisfied with just trying to accumulate the most money and toys. The good life is no longer just about the material instead, it can be found in a lifestyle that is devoted to mental, physical, and emotional health. A wellthy existence is one in which happiness is attainable, health is paramount, and daily living is about abundance. It s a life in which work is purposeful; friendships are deep and plentiful; and there s a daily sense of richness or overflowing joy. But since there s no one-size-fits all definition for a wellthy existence, I hope this book will serve as a guide to help you embark on your own personal journey that is both unique and meaningful. Eat. Move. Work. Believe. Explore. Breathe. Connect. Love. Heal. Thank. Ground. Live. Laugh. These are the building blocks of Wellth...and in this blend of memoir and prescriptive advice Jason Wachob shows us all how to enjoy truly wellthy lives lives that are deeply rich in every conceivable way. Through his experience and personal story, as well as in exclusive material from popular expert contributors (including Dr. Frank Lipman, Dr. Lissa Rankin, Joe Cross, Charlie Knoles, Kathryn Budig, Dr. Aviva Romm, and Dr. Sue Johnson), we learn how we too can embrace this new movement and develop richer, fuller, happier, healthier, and more meaningful lives. What will make your life more wellthy? Come and explore it.

German | 2 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658124644 | 92 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.64 MB

Das Lehrbuch führt in die Module Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung ein und beleuchtet die sich hier ergebenden Möglichkeiten von Serviceorientierung und Qualitätsmanagement. Bestehende Entwicklungen werden analysiert und im theoretischen und historischen Gesamtkontext erörtert. Weiterhin wird den interkommunalen Kooperationen auf den Gebieten Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung breiter Raum geschenkt.

Auf dem langen Weg hin zu einer Serviceorientierung von Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsförderung haben einige bundesdeutsche Kommunen bereits eine beachtliche Strecke zurückgelegt. Attraktivität und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit dieser Kommunen konnte mittels der bislang umgesetzten Maßnahmen erheblich gesteigert werden.Die erfolgreiche Implementierung serviceorientierter Denk- und Verhaltensweisen setzt eine intensive Beschäftigung mit dieser Thematik voraus, idealerweise in Form einer institutionalisierten Aus- und Weiterbildung. Auch hierbei liefern die Autoren wertvolle Unterstützung und praxiserprobte Hilfe.

English | 19 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 3319309986 | 66 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

This book studies the transformation of modern maritimity practices in coastal areas (such as swimming, navigation and tourism) and their implications to the development of Brazilian coastal cities, with an emphasis on the Northeast part of the country. It is a reflection on coastal geography in the tropics and the contemporary valorization of coastal cities from a socioeconomic, technological and symbolical point of view. The book highlights local fluxes on a regional and local scale, showing the incorporation of beach zones to spaces which were previously associated with so called traditional coastal practices (fishing activities and as harboring points). This book is dedicated to geography researchers and students.

Not Buying It: Stop Overspending and Start Raising Happier, Healthier, More Successful Kids by Brett Graff
2016 | ISBN: 1580055915 | English | 256 pages | EPUB | 2.3 MB

Most parents will do just about anything to secure happy lives and bright futures for their kids. Add in competition with other parents and near-constant pressure, their drive to give their kids the best of everything can backfire, setting back the child and the household finances. 

Brett Graff, "The Home Economist," exposes how overspending can harm children by setting back intellect and encouraging narcissism, depression and unhealthy or unsafe habits. By unearthing research on pricey baby gear, oversized houses, so-called "educational" toys and after-school lessons, expensive sports equipment and private coaching, even certain organic products and unregulated "natural" medicines - she even has eye-opening findings on private schools versus public schools - Graff proves that we can spend too much getting our kids ahead and wind up instead setting them back. 
Not Buying It proves that sound, rational decision-making about spending is far more beneficial for our kids than purchases made out of fear, pressure and confusion. With Graff's guidance, you'll confidently create the financial strategy that's best for your family, not the one pushed by marketers or practiced by your neighbors. Not Buying It is your blueprint for emotional and financial freedom, and the stability your children deserve.

Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism by Christine Desan
English | 2015 | ISBN: 0198709579, 0198709587 | 496 pages | EPUB | 2,7 MB

Money travels the modern world in disguise. It looks like a convention of human exchange - a commodity like gold or a medium like language. But its history reveals that money is a very different matter. It is an institution engineered by political communities to mark and mobilize resources. As societies change the way they create money, they change the market itself - along with the rules that structure it, the politics and ideas that shape it, and the benefits that flow from it.

One particularly dramatic transformation in money's design brought capitalism to England. For centuries, the English government monopolized money's creation. The Crown sold people coin for a fee in exchange for silver and gold. 'Commodity money' was a fragile and difficult medium; the first half of the book considers the kinds of exchange and credit it invited, as well as the politics it engendered. Capitalism arrived when the English reinvented money at the end of the 17th century. When it established the Bank of England, the government shared its monopoly over money creation for the first time with private investors, institutionalizing their self-interest as the pump that would produce the money supply. The second half of the book considers the monetary revolution that brought unprecedented possibilities and problems. The invention of circulating public debt, the breakdown of commodity money, the rise of commercial bank currency, and the coalescence of ideological commitments that came to be identified with the Gold Standard - all contributed to the abundant and unstable medium that is modern money. All flowed as well from a collision between the individual incentives and public claims at the heart of the system. The drama had constitutional dimension: money, as its history reveals, is a mode of governance in a material world. That character undermines claims in economics about money's neutrality. The monetary design innovated in England would later spread, producing the global architecture of modern money.

Compliance officers perform a vital, yet unpopular role in the business world as they advise on complying with myriad rules and regulations. What is good for compliance is sometimes seen as being bad for business, making a compliance officer's role a difficult tone. Essential Strategies for Financial Services Compliance offers practical guidance on how to apply a regulatory requirement to day to day situations. It also shows how to communicate the compliance department?s activities to the rest of the firm, how the role fits within the organization as a whole, what the scope and limitation of their responsibilities are, what to do when things go wrong, and how to deal with unusual problems.

Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World’s Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again by Peter J. Wallison
English | 2015 | ISBN: 1594037701 | 368 pages | PDF | 2 MB

The 2008 financial crisis—like the Great Depression—was a world-historical event. What caused it will be debated for years, if not generations. The conventional narrative is that the financial crisis was caused by Wall Street greed and insufficient regulation of the financial system. That narrative produced the Dodd-Frank Act, the most comprehensive financial-system regulation since the New Deal. There is evidence, however, that the Dodd-Frank Act has slowed the recovery from the recession. If insufficient regulation caused the financial crisis, then the Dodd-Frank Act will never be modified or repealed; proponents will argue that doing so will cause another crisis.

A competing narrative about what caused the financial crisis has received little attention. This view, which is accepted by almost all Republicans in Congress and most conservatives, contends that the crisis was caused by government housing policies. This book extensively documents this view. For example, it shows that in June 2008, before the crisis, 56 percent of all US mortgages were subprime or otherwise low-quality. Of these, 76 percent were on the books of government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these mortgages defaulted in 2007 and 2008, they drove down housing prices and weakened banks and other mortgage holders, causing the crisis.

After this book is published, no one will be able to claim that the financial crisis was caused by insufficient regulation, or defend Dodd-Frank, without coming to terms with the data this book contains.

The Politics of International Political Economy by Vassilis K. Fouskas
English | 2014 | ISBN: 1857436385 | 338 pages | PDF | 2 MB

This timely book will explain, via a number of thematic and case studies, that international economics is not an independent terrain of economic activity reproducing itself throughout history, but a complex articulation of social, political and culturally determined actions that are inextricably linked. Chapters will address the role of dominant global powers in the making of global industrial and monetary relations, and, in particular, ways in which, and the degrees to which dominant economic and military powers, such as the USA, tend to shape the domestic economic environments of lesser powers after their own image.

Supplementing the chapters will be a comprehensive A - Z glossary section, which will include key International Political Economy terms, e.g. international debt, European free trade area, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, IMF, GATT-WTO, Foreign exchange, fixed exchange rates, floating exchange rates, reserve currency, gold-dollar parity, multinational corporation, preferential trade agreement, hedge funds, etc. Entries will be cross-referenced for ease of use.

This book will be ideal for researchers and students in the areas of politics, international relations and international economics, as well as for academics, economists, business people, and those with an interest in the workings of international political economy.

Public Economics in an Age of Austerity (The Graz Schumpeter Lectures) By Tony Atkinson
2014 | 112 Pages | ISBN: 1138018155 | PDF | 2 MB


Governments all round the world are facing problems with their public finances. At a time of austerity, how much should spending be cut and how much should taxes be raised? Does the national debt represent a burden for future generations? Should taxes on the rich be raised? This book examines how the tools of public economics can be applied to answer such key questions and to suggest alternatives to the austerity policies currently being pursued. The fiscal problems faced are not simply the result of the post-2008 economic crisis but reflect a deep-seated fault line in modern economies. There has to be fiscal consolidation to provide for an ageing population, increased investment in education, and climate change. The book describes how public economics can help us think about alternative ways of meeting this challenge. It casts doubt on conventionally held views, such as those concerned with top tax rates, the undesirability of taxing capital income, the targeting of child benefits, and the merging of income tax and social security contributions. The final part goes beyond national boundaries and considers global public economics, focusing on the pressing problem of financing development. The conclusion of the book is that there are significant choices to be made. Not all austerity packages are the same: there are alternatives. It would be possible to raise taxes more and to cut spending less. It is important to consider the full range of possible policies. In considering these alternatives, modern public economics provides a useful framework, but it has major limitations. Economists are too often prisoners within the theoretical walls they have erected and fail to see that important considerations are missing. Economists have paid too little attention to the ethical basis underlying their policy recommendations.

Real Options Illustrated
Springer | Finance & Banking | Mar 24 2016 | ISBN-10: 331928309X | 107 pages | pdf | 2.88 mb

Authors: Peters, Linda
Discusses well-known Real Options Approaches and its applications step-by-step without the use of complex mathematics
Enables readers to reproduce these models and apply it to their own field
Contributes to one of the key challenges of Real Options, which is to reduce the gap between theory and practice

This book explains the standard Real Options Analysis (ROA) literature in a straightforward, step by step manner without the use of complex mathematics. A lot of ROA literature is described through partial differential equations, probability density functions and simulation techniques, all of which may be unconvincing in the applicable qualities ROA possesses. Using this book, the reader will have a better grasp about how ROA works and will be able to provide his or her judgment about ROA, since all the basics, as well as its positive and negative qualities, are discussed.
Real Options Illustrated provides practitioners with a real options framework and encourages readers to study the methodology using the in-depth explanations. This introduction to ROA is sufficient to equip readers with ROA basics, enabling them to perform future independent research. From this book, readers can judge whether ROA is of any value to their field.

The Handbook of Post Crisis Financial Modelling
Palgrave Macmillan UK | Finance & Banking | 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137494484 | 316 pages | pdf | 2.29 mb

Editors: Haven, E., Molyneux, P., Wilson, J., Fedotov, S., Duygun, M. (Eds.)

Following the 2008 financial crisis many questioned the academic community’s role in predicting the events that had unfolded, impacting heavily on the public's perception of the role of finance in society. Prior to the crisis, very little research existed to model events as extreme as those which occurred during the crisis. There is now greater interest in extreme event modeling than at any other time in history and, in addition, many facets of mainstream finance have evolved since the crisis.
This unique handbook brings together original research from leading practitioners and academics in the fields of banking, finance and financial history to explore key issues affecting financial modeling since the 2008 financial crisis. It offers theoretical, empirical, policy and practical insights into many of the key themes involved in the calibration of essential economic and financial variables that are used to model crises. The book begins by offering a historical context to the events, before moving on to discuss the role of central banks, governments, policy-making, the costs of bail-outs and the ‘too-big-to-fail’ controversy. The authors offer an analysis on the link between efficiency and bank safety, the role of ‘minimal assumptions’ in modeling and the private information price of risk (PIPR). They conclude by addressing the use of specific models and possible approaches to macroeconomic modeling for the future.

OECD, "How's Life 2015: Measuring Well-Being" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 9264211012 | 200 pages | PDF | 8 MB

Every person aspires to a good life. But what does “a good or a better life” mean? The third edition of How’s Life? provides an update on the most important aspects that shape people’s lives and well-being: income, jobs, housing, health, work-life balance, education, social connections, civic engagement and governance, environment, personal security, and subjective well-being. It paints a comprehensive picture of well-being in OECD countries and other major economies by looking at people’s material living conditions and quality of life across the population. Through a wide range of comparable well-being indicators, the report shows that countries perform differently in the various dimensions of well-being. For instance, low-income countries in the OECD area tend to do very well in subjective well-being and work-life balance, while their level of material well-being is much lower than that of other OECD countries. The report responds to the needs of citizens for better information on well-being and the needs of policymakers to give a more accurate picture of societal progress.

http://nitroflare.com/view/B505D70FC897D6E/0262034379.pdf
https://filejoker.net/jpj4zoe372a2


Hal S. Scott, "Connectedness and Contagion: Protecting the Financial System from Panics" 
English | ISBN: 0262034379 | 2016 | 439 pages | PDF | 3 MB

The Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 was intended to reform financial policies in order to prevent another massive crisis such as the financial meltdown of 2008. Dodd–Frank is largely premised on the diagnosis that connectedness was the major problem in that crisis—that is, that financial institutions were overexposed to one another, resulting in a possible chain reaction of failures. In this book, Hal Scott argues that it is not connectedness but contagion that is the most significant element of systemic risk facing the financial system. Contagion is an indiscriminate run by short-term creditors of financial institutions that can render otherwise solvent institutions insolvent. It poses a serious risk because, as Scott explains, our financial system still depends on approximately $7.4 to $8.2 trillion of runnable and uninsured short-term liabilities, 60 percent of which are held by nonbanks. 

Scott argues that efforts by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Treasury to stop the contagion that exploded after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers lessened the economic damage. And yet Congress, spurred by the public's aversion to bailouts, has dramatically weakened the power of the government to respond to contagion, including limitations on the Fed's powers as a lender of last resort. Offering uniquely detailed forensic analyses of the Lehman Brothers and AIG failures, and suggesting alternative regulatory approaches, Scott makes the case that we need to restore and strengthen our weapons for fighting contagion.

Morgan Ricks, "The Money Problem: Rethinking Financial Regulation" 
English | ISBN: 022633032X | 2016 | 360 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Years have passed since the world experienced one of the worst financial crises in history, and while countless experts have analyzed it, many central questions remain unanswered. Should money creation be considered a ‘public’ or ‘private’ activity—or both? What do we mean by, and want from, financial stability? What role should regulation play? How would we design our monetary institutions if we could start from scratch?

In The Money Problem, Morgan Ricks addresses all of these questions and more, offering a practical yet elegant blueprint for a modernized system of money and banking—one that, crucially, can be accomplished through incremental changes to the United States’ current system. He brings a critical, missing dimension to the ongoing debates over financial stability policy, arguing that the issue is primarily one of monetary system design. The Money Problem offers a way to mitigate the risk of catastrophic panic in the future, and it will expand the financial reform conversation in the United States and abroad.

Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground By Susan M. Opp
2013 | 346 Pages | ISBN: 1439880085 | PDF | 7 MB


A clear and practical examination of complex issues, Local Economic Development and the Environment: Finding Common Ground provides a broad, academic look at the intersection of two important areas for local administrators. In addition to managing development in a strained economic climate, most administrators are also expected to be stewards of the environment. However, economic conditions often leave them with limited options for pursuing economic development and, at the same time, being environmentally mindful. Many find themselves without a clear understanding of the concepts, tools, and best practices available to accomplish this herculean task. Translating complex environmental and economic concepts into easily applicable practices, the book: Gives practitioners the information they need to communicate with consultants, constituents, and officials, and to avoid ideological obstacles Compares regulatory differences between states and other geographical differences Includes examples from across the country to highlight variations in environmental regulations and laws Provides technical, legal, and political insights into the process of pursuing local economic development projects that incorporate protection and awareness Contains case studies that demonstrate the concepts in action, allowing readers to fully grasp the complexities associated with sustainable economic development Discusses how local administrators can balance the economic and environmental needs of the future Bridging the gap between policy-making intention and outcome, this book connects readers with a larger body of research that not only underpins practical applications but also helps them avoid legal, technical, and political obstacles. It provides an arsenal of best practices and everyday, easy-to-use strategies for optimizing the difficult balance between economic development and environmental protection.

Understanding Development: An Indian Perspective on Legal and Economic Policy (India Studies in Business and Economics) by Swapnendu Banerjee
English | 24 Sept. 2015 | ISBN: 813222454X, 8132234286 | 272 Pages | PDF (True) | 5.77 MB

This book addresses topical development issues in India, ranging from land acquisition, poverty alleviation programs, labor market issues, the public-private partnership (PPP) model and fiscal federalism. It offers an Indian perspective on the dynamics of economic development and the impact the country’s legal and public policies have on it. Economic development is a dynamic concept – old problems are solved, while at the same time new issues come to the fore. The emergence of these issues is unique to the development experience of an economy. The book includes sixteen recent contributions and is divided into four sections: law and contract; trade and foreign aid; issues in public economics; and the social sector and poverty alleviation. The chapters reflect on a number of development issues which were of concern for India in the recent past and will be important in her future development initiatives such as land acquisition, agricultural productivity, employment, protection of intellectual property rights, corruption, public-private partnership, regional development, poverty alleviations programs like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the training of self-help group members, health and education of women, to name a few. The book is a valuable reference resource for policy practitioners and researchers working on the economics of development with special focus on developing economies.

Judicial Sales of Ships: A Comparative Study (Hamburg Studies on Maritime Affairs) by Lief Bleyen
English | 25 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3319243748 | 220 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.24 MB

This work focuses on a specific aspect of the enforcement of maritime claims, namely judicial sales of ships, a procedure creditors typically resort to in the event of an irreversible default situation. A substantial part of the book approaches the topic from a comparative perspective, the goal being to assess the similarities and differences of the judicial sale procedure between three specific jurisdictions: Belgium, the Netherlands, and England & Wales. In this study, the comparison is used to further analyse the impacts of these differences on the effectiveness and reliability of the judicial sale procedure in each jurisdiction and also forms the basis for assessing the feasibility of harmonising judicial sale procedures and fostering their acceptance. Considering the international character typical of judicial sales of ships, conflict-of-law questions are very likely to arise during these procedures. Accordingly, the comparative study, where appropriate, is viewed against a private international law background.

Come ha scritto sul New York Times il columnist politico Jochen Bittner, "i leader europei dovrebbero ammettere che i cosiddetti euro-scettici hanno avuto spesso ragione, nel passato, e che è stato un errore bollarli come primitivi o reazionari eretici. Del resto, storicamente, gli eretici sono spesso stati coloro che alla fine hanno forzato un sistema di credenze a confrontarsi con le proprie contraddizioni. Lo stesso dovrebbe accadere all'interno dell'Unione Europea”.

Apocalypse Euro raccoglie alcune delle voci "eretiche" più importanti nel panorama europeo, a torto escluse dal racconto della crisi dal mainstream e oggi divenute, di conseguenza, il punto di riferimento per chi vuole trovare gli strumenti per uscire da questo "incubo”.

The Socio-Economic Evolution of the European Union: Exploring the Electronic Frontier
Springer | Economics | Aug. 5 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403036 | 128 pages | pdf | 1.4 mb

Authors: Mărcuț, Mirela
Explores the role of territory in the creation, maintenance and extension of the virtual space from a social and economic point of view
Examines the electronic frontier at a theoretical level using the European Union as a case study
Analyzes the evolution of the electronic frontier at a European level

This volume explores the role of territory in the creation, maintenance and extension of a new type of frontier, the electronic frontier, from a social and economic point of view. It departs from the earlier concepts of borders – state, social, economic, ethnic, religious, etc. – to investigate the fluidity of borders and their shift towards an axis-based paradigm within the free-movement European Union. Specifically, the authors will examine a) the metamorphoses of frontiers between the real and the virtual, b) the importance of space (territory) in the new information society and the Digital Single Market and c) the evolution of electronic frontiers in relation to globalization and the network society.
What happens when the Internet collides with new social and economic borders? In the past borders have been perceived from only a national state point of view. Now new types of borders or frontiers, such as social, economic, ethnic, religious frontiers, can be discussed. The electronic frontier is the result of a socio-economic analysis of the relationship between the Internet and new frontiers in society and the economy. The European space best represents the fluidity of borders and frontiers within this transformation. Thus, the European Union is the best space to perform research on the electronic frontiers. Borders are permeable or impermeable, agents of inclusiveness or of exclusion. The relations between the real space and the virtual space, but also the influence of the Internet on society, lead us to two other important concepts for our research, namely digital divide and digital inclusion, which define connections or barriers even within the virtual space.
This book attempts to answer questions such as:
What types of borders have information and communication technologies created in Europe?
Which is the foundation of these new frontiers?
How does the network society function in Europe and which type of frontier prevails?
This title aims to fill the gap in the literature in the relationship between frontiers and information and communication technologies.

Economics of Higher Education: Background, Concepts, and Applications by Robert K. Toutkoushian
English | 19 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 9401775044 | 404 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.23 MB

This book examines the many ways in which economic concepts, theories and models can be used to examine issues in higher education. The topics explored in the book include how students make college-going decisions, the payoffs to students and society from going to college, markets for higher education services, demand and supply in markets for higher education, why and how state and federal governments intervene in higher education markets, college and university revenues and expenditures, how institutions use net-pricing strategies and non-price product-differentiation strategies to pursue their goals and to compete in higher education markets, as well as issues related to faculty labor markets. The book is written for both economists and non-economists who study higher education issues and provides readers with background information and thorough explanations and illustrations of key economic concepts. In addition to reviewing the contributions economists have made to the study of higher education, it also examines recent research in each of the major topical areas. The book is policy-focused and each chapter analyses how contemporary higher education policies affect the behaviour of students, faculty and/or institutions of higher education. 

"Toutkoushian and Paulsen attempted a daunting task: to write a book on the economics of higher education for non-economists that is also useful to economists. A book that could be used for reference and as a textbook for higher education classes in economics, finance, and policy. They accomplish this tough balancing act with stunning success in a large volume that will serve as the go-to place for anyone interested in the history and current thinking on the economics of higher education.”

Handbook of Experimental Economic Methodology By Guillaume R. Fréchette, Andrew Schotter
2015 | 496 Pages | ISBN: 0195328329 | PDF | 3 MB


The Handbook of Experimental Economic Methodology, edited by Guillaume R. Fréchette and Andrew Schotter, aims to confront and debate the issues faced by the growing field of experimental economics. For example, as experimental work attempts to test theory, it raises questions about the proper relationship between theory and experiments. As experimental results are used to inform policy, the utility of these results outside the lab is questioned, and finally, as experimental economics tries to integrate ideas from other disciplines like psychology and neuroscience, the question of their proper place in the discipline of economics becomes less clear. This book contains papers written by some of the most accomplished scholars working at the intersection of experimental, behavioral, and theoretical economics talking about methodology. It is divided into four sections, each of which features a set of papers and a set of comments on those papers. The intention of the volume is to offer a place where ideas about methodology could be discussed and even argued. Some of the papers are contentious―-a healthy sign of a dynamic discipline―-while others lay out a vision for how the authors think experimental economics should be pursued. This exciting and illuminating collection of papers brings light to a topic at the core of experimental economics. Researchers from a broad range of fields will benefit from the exploration of these important questions.

Die Reform des steuerlichen Reisekostenrechts 2014 (Business, Economics, and Law) by Sarina Scheeler
German | 5 Jan. 2016 | ISBN: 3658120983 | 60 Pages | PDF (True) | 573.37 KB

Sarina Scheeler stellt die mit der Reform des steuerlichen Reisekostenrechts vorgenommenen gesetzlichen Änderungen übersichtlich dar und präzisiert die Unterschiede zur Rechtslage bis zum 31.12.2013. Sie setzt sich kritisch mit dem Begriff der ersten Tätigkeitsstätte in Bezug auf Gewinneinkünfte sowie mit den Auswirkungen der Reform auf die Unternehmenspraxis auseinander. Die Betrachtung der umfangreichen Änderungen zeigt, dass das steuerliche Reisekostenrecht auch künftig konfliktträchtig bleiben und die Gerichte beschäftigen wird. Die Ergebnisse offenbaren ferner, dass die Reform neben den vom Gesetzgeber angekündigten Vereinfachungen auch zu einer Verschärfung der Gesetzeslage geführt hat.

Le riforme a costo zero - Dieci proposte per tornare a crescere - Tito Boeri & Pietro Garibaldi
Italian | 2011 | 153 Pages | ISBN: 8861902308 | EPUB | 112.11 KB

Il ragionamento del "non ci sono i soldi per fare le riforme " apparentemente aristotelico e corretto - è invece profondamente sbagliato. Per due motivi, che sono alla base della decisione di scrivere questo libro. Il primo motivo è interno al ragionamento stesso. In Italia il vento della crescita non tornerà mai a spirare in poppa senza un vero e proprio programma di riforme. Il paese è praticamente fermo da quindici anni: tre quinquenni durante i quali l'economia mondiale è cresciuta come mai in passato. Nonostante la violenza della crisi globale, il 2009 è stato per il mondo solo una breve parentesi. Da noi invece sembra un incubo lungo vent'anni. Il vento della crescita soffia in varie parti del mondo, ma non tornerà mai a soffiare in Italia se non cambiamo atteggiamento. Il secondo errore nel ragionamento del "non ci sono i soldi" è invece un falso problema. Esistono moltissime e importantissime riforme che si possono fare "senza aumentare di un solo euro il debito pubblico". Sono le cosiddette Riforme a Costo Zero, il tema alla base di questo libro. In quasi tutti i campi cruciali dell'economia, è possibile cambiare le cose senza chiedere il conto a Pantalone: perché è vero che di soldi ce ne sono davvero pochi. Ma è anche vero che si possono fare importantissime riforme senza incidere sul bilancio pubblico. Richiedono solo di investire capitale politico nel cercare il consenso necessario. Una classe politica all'altezza può farcela. Gli ostacoli possono essere rimossi…

The Leap: How to Survive and Thrive in the Sustainable Economy by Chris Turner
English | 2012 | ISBN: 1611683718, 0307359239 | 372 pages | PDF | 1,3 MB

The crises in our economic system, our energy supply, and our climate are converging. Solving these crises requires a fundamental change in our frame of reference—a decisive shift not so much in technology as in technique. In The Leap, award-winning journalist Chris Turner presents a field guide to making the jump from our current system of energy supply and consumption to a sustainable model that succeeds across the socioeconomic spectrum. It is an integrated approach, one that he calls a “great leap sideways,” because it is a lateral leap that anyone can make: not escaping from, but moving toward.

Written with clarity and verve, The Leap draws on recent breakthroughs in state-of-the-art renewable energy, clean tech, and urban design to paint a picture of viable, sustainable economies that are already up and running, from Europe’s “green belt” to America’s “rust belt.” The leap Turner describes lands us in a place of reinvigorated community, renewed industrial might, and greater economic health and social well-being. He takes us there by exploring fascinating “great leaps” that have been made throughout history, and by tackling the biggest challenges we face now.

666 <--> Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective (Repost)
http://nitroflare.com/view/D9DDB99195F2EC7/0199374309_Financialspr.pdf


Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective By Nancy Morrow-Howell, Margaret Sherraden
2015 | 280 Pages | ISBN: 0199374309 | PDF | 13 MB


With today's availability of Social Security and Medicare, we typically think of the older years as a stage in life where people are supported financially. However, of the more than 40 million old adults currently living in the US, many are struggling financially living below or near the poverty line. They are lacking the assets necessary to see them through a period of life that is often longer than expected and that requires more health and long-term care. While financial vulnerability can be most pronounced in old age, it is often created across decades, revealing itself in later years when there is little opportunity to reverse a lifetime of disadvantage. The concept of Financial Capability refers to both an individual and structural idea that combines a person's ability to act with their opportunity to act in their best financial interests. In Financial Capability and Asset Holding in Later Life: A Life Course Perspective the concept of Financial Capability is used to underscore the importance of acquiring knowledge and skills while also addressing policies and services than can build financial security. The volume assembles the latest evidence on financial capability and assets among older adults using a life course perspective, arguing that older adults need financial knowledge and financial services in order to build secure lives, and that this process needs to begin before it is too late to make effective changes and choices. Broken into three parts, the chapters in this book written by leading experts in the field blend together empirical findings, economic and social theory, and case studies. Part 1 opens the book with a conceptual and empirical overview of financial capability and assets among older adults using a life course perspective. Part 2 presents chapters addressing financial vulnerability of diverse racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, and immigrants. Part 3 includes chapters describing current policies, programs, and innovations, including a review of important issues of working and caregiving in later life, and a detailed assessment of äge-friendly¨banking principles, banking products, services, and policies.

Finding a Voice at Work?: New Perspectives on Employment Relations By Stewart Johnstone, Peter Ackers
2015 | 336 Pages | ISBN: 0199668000 | PDF | 2 MB


How much 'say' should employees have in the running of business organizations, and what form should the 'voice' take? This is both the oldest and latest question in employment relations. Answers to these questions reflect our fundamental assumptions about the nature of the employment relationship, and inform our views on almost every aspect of Human Resource Management (HRM) and Employment Relations. Voice can also mean different things to different people. For some, employee voice is a synonym for trade union representation which aims to defend and promote the collective interests of workers. For others voice, is means of enhancing employee commitment and organisational performance. Others advocate workers control as an alternative to conventional capitalist organisations which are run for shareholders. There is thus both a moral and political argument for a measure of democracy at work, as well as a business case argument, which views voice as a potential link in the quest for increased organisational performance. The key debate for employment relations is which of the approaches 'works best' in delivering outcomes which balance competitiveness and productivity, on the one hand, and fair treatment of workers and social justice on the other. Policy makers need pragmatic answers to enduring questions: what works best in different contexts, what are the conditions of success, and what are the drawbacks? Some of the most significant developments in employee voice have taken place within the European Union, with various public policy and employer experiments attracting extensive academic research. The book offers a critical assessment of the main contemporary concepts and models of voice in the UK and Europe, and provides an in-depth theoretical and empirical exploration of employee voice in one accessible and cohesive collection.

Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness: A Network Approach to Measurement and Monitoring By Francis X. Diebold, Kamil Yilmaz
2015 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0199338299 , 0199338302 | PDF | 20 MB


Connections among different assets, asset classes, portfolios, and the stocks of individual institutions are critical in examining financial markets. Interest in financial markets implies interest in underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. In Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness, Frank Diebold and Kamil Yilmaz propose a simple framework for defining, measuring, and monitoring connectedness, which is central to finance and macroeconomics. These measures of connectedness are theoretically rigorous yet empirically relevant. The approach to connectedness proposed by the authors is intimately related to the familiar econometric notion of variance decomposition. The full set of variance decompositions from vector auto-regressions produces the core of the 'connectedness table.' The connectedness table makes clear how one can begin with the most disaggregated pair-wise directional connectedness measures and aggregate them in various ways to obtain total connectedness measures. The authors also show that variance decompositions define weighted, directed networks, so that these proposed connectedness measures are intimately related to key measures of connectedness used in the network literature. After describing their methods in the first part of the book, the authors proceed to characterize daily return and volatility connectedness across major asset (stock, bond, foreign exchange and commodity) markets as well as the financial institutions within the U.S. and across countries since late 1990s. These specific measures of volatility connectedness show that stock markets played a critical role in spreading the volatility shocks from the U.S. to other countries. Furthermore, while the return connectedness across stock markets increased gradually over time the volatility connectedness measures were subject to significant jumps during major crisis events. This book examines not only financial connectedness, but also real fundamental connectedness. In particular, the authors show that global business cycle connectedness is economically significant and time-varying, that the U.S. has disproportionately high connectedness to others, and that pairwise country connectedness is inversely related to bilateral trade surpluses.

Lester M. Salamon, "New Frontiers of Philanthropy: A Guide to the New Tools and New Actors that Are Reshaping Global Philanthropy" 
English | ISBN: 0199357544 | 2014 | 768 pages | PDF | 7 MB

With the resources of both governments and traditional philanthropy barely growing or in decline, yet the problems of poverty, ill-health and environmental degradation ballooning daily, it is increasingly clear that new models for financing and promoting social and environmental objectives have become urgently needed. 

Fortunately, however, a significant revolution appears to be underway in the way in which social and environmental purposes are being financed. The heart of this revolution is a massive explosion in the instruments and institutions being deployed to mobilize private resources in support of social and environmental objectives. Where earlier such support was limited to charitable gifts, now a bewildering array of new instruments and institutions has surfaced-loans, loan guarantees, private equity, barter arrangements, social stock exchanges, bonds, secondary markets, investment funds, and many more-all of them designed to leverage not just the tens of billions of dollars of philanthropic grants but the hundreds of billions, indeed trillions, of dollars of private investment capital. 

While the changes under way are inspiring and by no means trivial, however, they remain largely uncharted in any systematic fashion. This monograph, and of the companion volume for which it also serves as the introductory chapter, is designed to overcome this problem, to provide the first comprehensible and accessible roadmap to the full range of important new developments taking place on the frontiers of philanthropy and social investment. In the process, it seeks to broaden awareness of these developments, increase their credence and traction, and make it possible to maximize the benefits they can generate while acknowledging the limitations and challenges they also face.

English | ISBN: 1420088750 | 2010 | 417 pages | PDF | 3 MB

Market disruptions, climate change, and health pandemics lead the growing list of challenges faced by today’s leaders. These issues, along with countless others that do not make the daily news, require novel thinking and collaborative action to find workable solutions. However, many administrators stumble into collaboration without a strategic orientation. Using a practitioner-oriented style, Strategic Collaboration in Public and Nonprofit Administration: A Practice-Based Approach to Solving Shared Problems provides guidance on how to collaborate more effectively, with less frustration and better results. 


The authors articulate an approach that takes advantage of windows of opportunity for real problem solving; brings multi-disciplinary participants to the table to engage more systematically in planning, analysis, decision making, and implementation; breaks down barriers to change; and ultimately, lays the foundation for new thinking and acting.

Glenn McGovern, "Protective Operations: A Handbook for Security and Law Enforcement"
English | ISBN: 1439851719 | 2011 | 224 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Protective Operations: A Handbook for Security and Law Enforcement is designed as a reference for law enforcement and security organizations tasked with protecting the welfare of an individual or groups of individuals. To be effective and professional, protective operations require the incorporation of a variety of skill sets. However, many departments and jurisdictions have only limited resources and training available. Filling this void, the book identifies issues particular to local law enforcement — and the private security teams that may be called in later — and offers suggestions and guidance for confronting high-threat scenarios as well as the more mundane protective details.

Highlights:


Details the essence of local law enforcement protective operations that are run, in large part, covertly 
Examines threat assessment from both hostile organizations and unknown adversaries
Provides a solid understanding of operational security, situational awareness, and surveillance detection
Includes examples from real-world attacks occurring over the past sixty years 
Reinforces the need for training in specific tactics and techniques
Emphasizes training for confronting the adversary
Focuses on the economics of providing the most protection for the least cost
Addresses issues surrounding possible direct violations of the law and department policy and procedures



The author’s decades of training, research, and experience provide invaluable tested and proven protocols for keeping subjects safe in a hostile environment.

Ian Dennis, "The Nature of Accounting Regulation" 
English | ISBN: 0415891957 | 2013 | 142 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Accounting standards are an essential element in the regulation of current financial reporting. Standard setters promulgate such standards, and companies and professional accountants follow them in preparing financial reports. Although much has been written about the history of standard setting, the conceptual underpinnings of accounting standards, the process of setting them, and whether such standards should be ‘rules-based’ or ‘principles-based,’ there has been little written about the kind of thing they are. This book examines the nature of accounting standards and the very idea of a rule, of implementation guidance, and of the objectives that are included in them. It enables the reader to grasp the reasons for promulgating standards, the role of the conceptual framework in setting standards in an institutional context, and the kind of rules that are useful in regulating financial reporting. The insights provided by this examination are used to throw light on the distinction between ‘principles-based’ and ‘rules-based’ standards and on the nature of ‘good’ accounting standards.'

Thomas C. Leonard, "Illiberal Reformers: Race, Eugenics, and American Economics in the Progressive Era" 
2016 | ISBN: 0691169594 | 264 pages | PDF | 2 MB

Praised by the New York Times Book Review as a "vital account of the perils of intellectual arrogance," a troubling story of liberal economists, race, and eugenics In Illiberal Reformers, Thomas Leonard reexamines the economic progressives whose ideas and reform agenda underwrote the Progressive Era dismantling of laissez-faire and the creation of the regulatory welfare state, which, they believed, would humanize and rationalize industrial capitalism. But not for all. Academic social scientists such as Richard T. Ely, John R. Commons, and Edward A. Ross, together with their reform allies in social work, charity, journalism, and law, played a pivotal role in establishing minimum-wage and maximum-hours laws, workmen's compensation, progressive income taxes, antitrust regulation, and other hallmarks of the regulatory welfare state. But even as they offered uplift to some, economic progressives advocated exclusion for others, and did both in the name of progress. Leonard meticulously reconstructs the influence of Darwinism, racial science, and eugenics on scholars and activists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, revealing a reform community deeply ambivalent about America's poor. Economic progressives championed labor legislation because it would lift up the deserving poor while excluding immigrants, African Americans, women, and "mental defectives," whom they vilified as low-wage threats to the American workingman and to Anglo-Saxon race integrity. Economic progressives rejected property and contract rights as illegitimate barriers to needed reforms. But their disregard for civil liberties extended much further. Illiberal Reformers shows that the intellectual champions of the regulatory welfare state proposed using it not to help those they portrayed as hereditary inferiors, but to exclude them.

Make more money with your money. 
Invest in stocks to make the big bucks and start saving for retirement now. 
You want to be debt-free in your swinging sixties.

Presents current insights, developments and trends in experimental economics
Features research in such areas as management science, decision theory, game theory, marketing and political science
Presents possibilities of using various computer methods in the scope of experimental economics
Merges findings and knowledge from various domains for the purposes of experimental economics

The aim of this volume is to provide deep insights and the latest scientific developments and trends in experimental economics. Derived from the 2015 Computational Methods in Experimental Economics (CMEE) conference, this book features papers containing research and analysis of economic experiments concerning research in such areas as management science, decision theory, game theory, marketing and political science. The goal is to present possibilities for using various computer methods in the scope of experimental economics to further provide researchers with a wide variety of tools. 
The field of experimental economics is rapidly evolving. Modern use of experimental economics requires the integration of knowledge in the domains of economic sciences, computer science, psychology, and neuroscience. Recent research includes experiments conducted both in the laboratory and in the field, and the results are used for testing and a better understanding of economic theories. Researchers working in this field use mainly a set of well-established methods and computer tools that support the experiments. Methods such as artificial intelligence, computer simulation and computer graphics, however, are not represented enough in experimental economics studies and most experimenters do not consider their usage. The goal of the conference and the enclosed papers is to allow for an exchange of experiences and to promote joint initiatives to insight change in this trend.

Economics of Immigration: The Impact of Immigration on the Australian Economy
Palgrave Macmillan | Labor Economics | Mar 9 2016 | ISBN-10: 1137555246 | 344 pages | pdf | 2.66 mb

Editors: Junankar, P. N. (Raja) (Ed.)

Poverty, famines, wars, and ethnic conflicts lead to large movements of refugees. The papers in this book provide an analysis of the economics of immigration. Junankar discusses why people migrate, the likely destinations for migrants, and their employment in the destination countries. He studies the benefits to the migrant families in terms of higher wages and living standards, and also studies how immigrants fare in the Australian labour markets in terms of finding good jobs, and whether there is discrimination against them. Economics of Immigration analyses the macroeconomic impacts of immigration on the Australian economy and discusses why some groups favour immigration while other groups are against it. Junankar argues immigration has been beneficial for employment and growth; not only adding to labour supply but also to labour demand, hence leading to favourable outcomes. This collection of essays shows how immigration has helped the economic development of Australia, while also highlighting that the historical reasons for immigration lie in the colonisation of many countries in Asia and Africa.

Empirical Evidence on the Macroeconomic Effects of EU Cohesion Policy
Springer Gabler | Public Finance | Jun 1, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3658138513 | 173 pages | pdf | 4.46 mb

Authors: Mohl, Philipp
Publication in the field of economic sciences

Philipp Mohl evaluates the macroeconomic effects of EU Cohesion Policy with the help of empirical methods. His findings indicate that in particular the part of EU Cohesion Policy which is spent for the poorest regions (the so-called Objective 1 funding) has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth. Moreover, the employment effects of EU Cohesion Policy seem to be conditional on the educational attainment, i.e., in particular regions with a high share of high-skilled population tend to benefit from EU funds. Finally, the author does not find evidence that EU funds significantly increase public investment in the EU countries, which points to a crowding out of national investment. Overall, the gained insights contribute to a more profound understanding of the macroeconomic effects of EU Cohesion Policy, which is essential to design an effective and efficient EU spending system.

Fred Yager, Jan Yager, "Idiot's Guides: Social Security"
ISBN: 1615647414 | 2015 | PDF | 304 pages | 9 MB

Along with Medicare, Social Security is one of the "rites of passage" as older Americans retire. After contributing funds to this program their entire working life, people are anxious to start getting their monthly checks.

Coverage includes enrolling in Social Secuirty for disability and survival benefits, as well benefits from the traditional age-requirement. The book also has a decision tree to make perfectly clear what one's benefits are depending on such factors as how early one benefits are taken, marital status, and what one believes his or her future may hold. The future of Social Security is also explored and with that possible impacts on one's future benefits.

"Asset-based" approaches to development are aimed specifically at designing and implementing public policies that will increase the capital assets of the poor —i.e., the physical, financial, human, social, and natural resources that can be acquired, developed, improved, and transferred across generations.

Più uguali più ricchi - Yoram Gutgeld
Italian | 2013 | 214 Pages | ISBN: 8817070564 | EPUB | 980.41 KB

Non abbiamo bisogno di manovre o aggiustamenti, quello che ci serve è un cambio di orizzonte mentale, un nuovo paradigma economico, sociale e politico che rompa con gli schemi del passato: analizzando le numerose occasioni perse dal nostro bipolarismo imperfetto negli ultimi vent'anni, Yoram Gutgeld dimostra in questa sua appassionata analisi che il declino del nostro Paese non è un processo irreversibile e che possiamo ancora tornare competitivi. Ma per ripartire dobbiamo subito accantonare una serie di luoghi comuni e alibi che non solo hanno impoverito il nostro dibattito politico, ma hanno oscurato i veri problemi che attanagliano il Paese. Dagli sprechi della pubblica amministrazione alle inefficienze della sanità, dalle occasioni mancate nel settore turistico alle buste paga dei lavoratori che devono assolutamente ricominciare a crescere, l'autore osserva le singole realtà italiane avanzando ogni volta proposte concrete, e spesso a costo zero, che permettano di superare le criticità. "Più uguali, più ricchi" racconta un Paese in cui la prima battaglia da vincere è proprio quella contro le iniquità che non sono solo all'origine dell'ingiustizia sociale, ma rappresentano anche un freno allo sviluppo economico. Portare l'equità al centro del dibattito politico non significa creare un Paese di uguali, ma uno in cui le imprese riescono a operare al meglio e le persone vengono premiate secondo le proprie capacità.

German | ISBN: 365800844X | 2014 | 118 pages | PDF | 4 MB

Sie wünschen sich Erfolg - aber der will sich einfach nicht einstellen? Wenn Sie gerne erfolgreich wären, es aber Ihrer Meinung nach (noch) nicht sind, könnten Sie sich im Grunde davor fürchten und unbewusst Ihre eigenen Anstrengungen sabotieren.

Jason Vitug, "You Only Live Once: The Roadmap to Financial Wellness and a Purposeful Life"
ISBN: 1119267366 | 2016 | EPUB | 192 pages | 501 KB

Get your finances in order with smart budgeting and money mindfulness.

You Only Live Once is the guide to achieving your best life through smart money moves. Before you even begin making a budget, you need to think about why. Where do you see yourself financially in ten years? Five years? This time next year? What does money do for you? Once you know your destination, you can begin charting your course. Step-by-step guidance walks you through the budgeting process, and shows you how to plan your financial path to point toward your goals. You'll learn how to prioritize spending, how to save efficiently, and how to take advantage of simple tools you didn't know you had. Next comes the most important part: taking control. You need to really look at how you perceive and use money day-to-day. Chances are, changing a few habits could give you some breathing room and help you reach your goals sooner. 

You work hard for your money, yet there never seems to be enough. You don't need to live like a pauper, but you need to be truly aware of just where your money is going, and why. Financial awareness is the key to a financially secure future, and this book unpacks it all to help you get where you want to go.

Accept past decisions and articulate your financial goals
Align your lifestyle with your budget
Explore your relationship with money
Re-evaluate financial habits and behaviors

You know you need a budget, but you never seem to get around to doing it. Or maybe you did, but you can never seem to stick to it. Smart planning is a major factor in financial security, and it involves just as much introspection as math. You Only Live Once is more than a budgeting guide—it's a guide to revamping your financial behaviors to achieve the life you want.

http://nitroflare.com/view/E9A42811E06A46D/1623170621.epub


Vandana Shiva, "Who Really Feeds the World?: The Failures of Agribusiness and the Promise of Agroecology" 
English | ISBN: 1623170621 | 2016 | 192 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Debunking the notion that our current food crisis must be addressed through industrial agriculture and genetic modification, author and activist Vandana Shiva argues that those forces are in fact the ones responsible for the hunger problem in the first place. Who Really Feeds the World? is a powerful manifesto calling for agricultural justice and genuine sustainability, drawing upon Shiva’s thirty years of research and accomplishments in the field. Instead of relying on genetic modification and large-scale monocropping to solve the world’s food crisis, she proposes that we look to agroecology—the knowledge of the interconnectedness that creates food—as a truly life-giving alternative to the industrial paradigm. Shiva succinctly and eloquently lays out the networks of people and processes that feed the world, exploring issues of diversity, the needs of small famers, the importance of seed saving, the movement toward localization, and the role of women in producing the world's food.

Ci prendono per fessi - L'economia della manipolazione e del'inganno - George A. Akerlof & Robert J. Shiller
Italian | 2016 | 335 Pages | ISBN: 8804663227 | EPUB | 681.2 KB

Fin dai tempi di Adam Smith, il pensiero economico ha tessuto le lodi del libero mercato che, quasi fosse governato da una mano invisibile, riuscirebbe a conciliare la ricerca dell'interesse personale con il benessere dell'intera società, trasformando il vantaggio individuale in bene comune. A questa concezione idilliaca lanciano una sfida radicale due premi Nobel dell'economia, George Akerlof e Robert Shiller, sostenendo che i mercati ci procurano tanti danni quanti benefici, e lungi dall'essere fondamentalmente benigni sono intrinsecamente disseminati di trappole e di esche cui finiamo per abboccare. Perché ogni volta che c'è un profitto da ricavare, i venditori non esiteranno a sfruttare le nostre debolezze psicologiche, la nostra superficialità e la nostra ignoranza per manipolarci e piazzarci la loro merce al prezzo più alto. È più che legittimo, quindi, applicare all'intero ambito dell'economia quella nozione di "phishing" nata fin dagli albori di Internet per definire il raggiro online, la "pesca degli ingenui" cui carpire informazioni, dati e, in definitiva, denaro. Ma mentre quella compiuta in Rete è un'azione illegale, un reato perseguito per legge, in economia è da sempre una pratica comune e indiscussa: raggirare ed essere raggirati è parte integrante dei rapporti fra gli attori del mercato. Per dimostrare la loro tesi, Akerlof e Shiller riportano una gran quantità di aneddoti ed episodi che rivelano come il phishing riguardi chiunque e ogni aspetto della nostra vita.

NGOs are as Canadian as hockey, declared a 1988 Parliamentary report. Few institutions epitomize the foundational Canadian myth of international benevolence like the non-governmental organization devoted to development abroad. This book raises important questions about these organizations and their development projects: Just how non-governmental are organizations that get most of their funding from government agencies? What impact do these funding ties have on NGOs' ability to support popular demands for democratic reforms and wealth redistribution? What happens when NGOs support a repressive regime? What happens when NGOs bite the hand that feeds them?

Gregory T. Haugan, "The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios" 
English | ISBN: 1466505184 | 2012 | 420 pages | PDF | 5 MB

The ongoing changes in population, climate, and the availability of energy have resulted in unprecedented threats and opportunities that all project and program managers, portfolio managers, and public planners need to be aware of. The New Triple Constraints for Sustainable Projects, Programs, and Portfolios offers a clear look at how these constraints will impact project undertakings and overlay the current classic constraints of cost, schedule, and performance. 

The book provides current facts and information on population, climate change, and energy issues—identifying trends and outlining opportunities in the form of a set of overlays (summary conclusions). The overlays are indexed to current changes that collectively represent a major turning point in the way we use resources and our growing need to seek sustainability. Identifying how changes in the new triple constraints will impact long-range planning, the book: 

Explains the rationale behind population forecasts and the likely impact on global supply and demand 
Highlights emerging trends in global temperatures and sea level rise, and the impacts on ecology, biology, and the marine environment without political spin
Includes SWOT analyses of fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and renewable fuels to assist in planning programs that depends upon these energy sources
Provides expert estimates and forecasts of energy availability and alternatives
Discusses the risks of various energy options
Contains supporting Appendices and a comprehensive Bibliography

Most program life cycles last five to ten years, and infrastructure programs last 40 to 50 years; the text provides a rational basis for approaching the new problems that all program and portfolio managers will soon have to deal with. It will help you identify and recognize these current and projected circumstances and risks so you will understand and be prepared to make the most of the major changes impacting the upcoming decision environment.

Mindset: The New Psychology of Success By Carol S. Dweck
2008 | 288 Pages | ISBN: 0345472322 | EPUB + MOBI | 3 MB


Mindset is one of those rare books that can help you make positive changes in your life and at the same time see the world in a new way. A leading expert in motivation and personality psychology, Carol Dweck has discovered in more than twenty years of research that our mindset is not a minor personality quirk: it creates our whole mental world. It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets. If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone–either you have them or you don’t. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity–and success. Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting. She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields–music, literature, science, sports, business–apply the growth mindset to achieve results. Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment. She looks across a broad range of applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. Highly engaging and very practical, Mindset breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.

Common Stocks and Common Sense: The Strategies, Analyses, Decisions, and Emotions of a Particularly Successful Value Investor by Edgar Wachenheim III
2016 | ISBN: 1119259606 | English | 224 pages | EPUB | 0.4 MB

Deep insight and candid discussion from one of Wall Street's best investors
Common Stocks and Common Sense provides detailed insight into common stock investing, using a case-study approach based on real-world investments. Author Edgar Wachenheim is the 28-year CEO of Greenhaven Associates, boasting an average annual portfolio comparable to Warren Buffet's. In this book, he shares his knowledge and experiences by providing detailed analyses of actual investments made by himself and other investors. The discussion covers the entire investment process, including the softer, human side, with candid insight into the joys and frustrations, intensities and pressures, and risks and uncertainties. The unique emphasis on behavioral economics and real-world cases set this book apart from the herd—but it's Wachenheim himself and his deeply-examined perspective that elevates the book beyond a mere investing guide.

Between 1990 and 2014, a typical portfolio managed by Wachenheim enjoyed an average annual return in excess of 18%, achieved using relatively conservative stocks and no financial leverage. As a proponent of evidence and example, his analysis of real cases serve as a valuable education for anyone looking to improve their own investment practices.

Understand investment through the lens of a Wall Street leader
Dig into the details of real-world common stock investing
Learn how to invest creatively and minimize risk
Go beyond theory to study strategy on a case-by-case basis
Investment principles and strategies are easy to find—entire libraries have been written about theories and methods and what 'should' happen. But this book goes beyond the typical guide to show you how these ideas are applied in the real world—and what actually happened. Investors seeking real insight, real expertise, and a proven track record will find Common Stocks and Common Sense a uniquely useful resource.

German | 17 Jan. 2016 | ISBN: 3658121092 | 116 Pages | PDF (True) | 1017.27 KB

Die Arbeit untersucht den Einfluss des psychologischen Persönlichkeitskonstrukts der Dunklen Triade, bestehend aus Narzissmus, Psychopathie und Machiavellismus, auf die Strategien der Emotionsarbeit sowie der daraus resultierenden positiven und negativen Konsequenzen für Angestellte im Dienstleistungssektor. Die Daten einer hierfür konzipierten Online-Befragung von 255 Dienstleistungsmitarbeitern zeigen, dass Psychopathen und Narzissten Oberflächenhandeln nutzen, um ihre Emotionen in der Interaktion mit Kunden zu regulieren. Letztere wenden auch die Strategie des Tiefenhandelns an. Zudem bestätigen die Befunde, dass Oberflächenhandeln den Einfluss der Dunklen Triade auf Erschöpfung vermittelt, wobei Tiefenhandeln als partieller Mediator in der Beziehung von Narzissmus und Engagement fungiert. Engagement erhöht in der Folge die Zufriedenheit und Leistung des Angestellten.

http://nitroflare.com/view/B40549634EDB555/0262034573.pdf


The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism (MIT Press) by Arun Sundararajan
2016 | ISBN: 0262034573 | English | 256 pages | PDF | 6 MB

Sharing isn't new. Giving someone a ride, having a guest in your spare room, running errands for someone, participating in a supper club – these are not revolutionary concepts. What is new, in the "sharing economy," is that you are not helping a friend for free; you are providing these services to a stranger for money. In this book, Arun Sundararajan, an expert on the sharing economy, explains the transition to what he describes as "crowd-based capitalism" – a new way of organizing economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model. As peer-to-peer commercial exchange blurs the lines between the personal and the professional, how will the economy, government regulation, what it means to have a job, and our social fabric be affected?

Drawing on extensive research and numerous real-world examples – including Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Etsy, TaskRabbit, France's BlaBlaCar, China's Didi Kuaidi, and India's Ola, Sundararajan explains the basics of crowd-based capitalism. He describes the intriguing mix of "gift" and "market" in its transactions, demystifies emerging blockchain technologies, and clarifies the dizzying array of emerging on-demand platforms. He considers how this new paradigm changes economic growth and the future of work. Will we live in a world of empowered entrepreneurs who enjoy professional flexibility and independence? Or will we become disenfranchised digital laborers scurrying between platforms in search of the next wedge of piecework? Sundararajan highlights the important policy choices and suggests possible new directions for self-regulatory organizations, labor law, and funding our social safety net.

http://nitroflare.com/view/34490DD59DAAFAB/0199378320_From.pdf


From Big Data to Big Profits: Success with Data and Analytics By Russell Walker
2015 | 312 Pages | ISBN: 0199378320 | PDF | 3 MB


Vast holdings and assessment of consumer data by large companies are not new phenomena. Firms' ability to leverage the data to reach customers in targeted campaigns and gain market share is, and on an unprecedented scale. Major companies have moved from serving as data or inventory storehouses, suppliers, and exchange mechanisms to monetizing their data and expanding the products they offer. Such changes have implications for both firms and consumers in the coming years. In Success with Big Data, Russell Walker investigates the use of internal Big Data to stimulate innovations for operational effectiveness, and the ways in which external Big Data is developed for gauging, or even prompting, customer buying decisions. Walker examines the nature of Big Data, the novel measures they create for market activity, and the payoffs they can offer from the connectedness of the business and social world. With case studies from Apple, Netflix, Google, and Amazon, Walker both explores the market transformations that are changing perceptions of Big Data, and provides a framework for assessing and evaluating Big Data. Although the world appears to be moving toward a marketplace where consumers will be able to "pull" offers from firms, rather than simply receiving offers, Walker observes that such changes will require careful consideration of legal and unspoken business practices as they affect consumer privacy. Rigorous and meticulous, Success with Big Data is a valuable resource for graduate students and professionals with an interest in Big Data, digital platforms, and analytics.

Management Gurus and Management Fashions by Brad Jackson
English | Apr. 28, 2001 | ISBN: 0415249465, 0415249457 | 225 Pages | PDF | 1 MB

Since the 1980s, popular management thinkers, ‘gurus’, have promoted a number of performance improvement programs and management fashions which have greatly influenced both the everyday conduct of organizational life and the preoccupations of academic researchers. This book provides a rhetorical critique of the management guru and management fashion phenomenon, building on the important theoretical progress that has recently been made by a small, but growing band of management researchers.
Fantasy theme analysis, a dramatically-based method of rhetorical criticism, is conducted to critique three of the most important management fashions to have emerged during the 1990s:
* the re-engineering movement promoted by Michael Hammer and James Champy
* the effectiveness movement led by Stephen Covey
* the learning organization movement inspired by Peter Senge and his colleagues.
In addition to its rhetorical and empirical contributions, this book stimulates a much-needed critical dialogue between practitioners and academics on the sources of the underlying appeal of management gurus and management fashions, and their effect upon the quality of management and organizational learning.

Globalization and the Race to the Bottom in Developing Countries: Who Really Gets Hurt? by Nita Rudra
English | Oct. 13, 2008 | ISBN: 0521715032, 0521886988 | 316 Pages | PDF | 2 MB

The advance of economic globalization has led many academics, policy-makers, and activists to warn that it leads to a 'race to the bottom'. In a world increasingly free of restrictions on trade and capital flows, developing nations that cut public services are risking detrimental effects to the populace. Conventional wisdom suggests that it is the poorer members of these societies who stand to lose the most from these pressures on welfare protections, but this new study argues for a more complex conceptualization of the subject. Nita Rudra demonstrates how and why domestic institutions in developing nations have historically ignored the social needs of the poor; globalization neither takes away nor advances what never existed in the first place. It has been the lower- and upper-middle classes who have benefited the most from welfare systems and, consequently, it is they who are most vulnerable to globalization's race to the bottom.

Making Global Value Chains: Geographies of Market-Oriented Development in Ghana and Peru by Dorothee Niebuhr
English | 20 Apr. 2016 | ISBN: 3658132868 | 304 Pages | PDF (True) | 4.13 MB

This book investigates the recent rise of the market-oriented value chain approach in development policy with a focus on the agro-export sector in the Global South. The research project aims at unveiling the political, social and cultural processes around the circulation of market rationales at the global scale and on the ground. In-depth analyses of two exemplary settings, Peru and Ghana, reveal the extent to which national policies, development programs, laws and academic curricula have adopted a "thinking in terms of value chains" in the last decade. By embracing the perspectives of policymakers, consultants, entrepreneurs and producers, this book provides exciting first-hand insights about the making of markets for scholars and development practitioners alike.

Die Ergebnisse seiner regressionsbasierten Modellschätzung verdeutlichen, dass bei geltender Käuferanonymität die freiwillige Zahlungsbereitschaft durch einen vom Verkäufer kommunizierten externen Referenzpreis positiv beeinflusst wird. Dieser Effekt wird bei Gütern mit niedrigen variablen Kosten über das soziale Motiv der Fairness mediiert.

Unternehmensfitness: 'raus aus dem Mittelmaß!: Systematisches Training von Arbeits- und Verhaltensweisen für nachhaltigen Erfolg by Volkmar Völzke
German | 27 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658087498 | 179 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.06 MB

Dieses neuartige Fitnessbuch für unternehmerische Leistungssteigerung gibt allen Managern und Geschäftsleitern konkrete und erprobte Trainingspläne an die Hand, die sie direkt in ihrem Unternehmen oder ihrer Abteilung umsetzen können – mit garantiert positivem Effekt auf die nachhaltige Leistungsfähigkeit der Mitarbeiter.

Denn nachhaltiger unternehmerischer Erfolg muss genauso wie im Spitzensport systematisch trainiert werden, und zwar in allen Dimensionen wie zum Beispiel Führung, Kundenfokus, Begeisterung der Mannschaft und operative Leistungsfähigkeit.

Die meisten Manager, Teams und Unternehmen bleiben aber weit unter Ihren Möglichkeiten, weil sie Erfolg zu sehr an äußere Umstände koppeln anstatt an die verborgenen Kräfte im eigenen Unternehmen. Genau wie die besten Mannschaften im Spitzensport sind auch die dauerhaft erfolgreichsten Unternehmen nicht durch „glückliche Umstände“ dauerhaft an der Spitze, sondern, weil sie alle entscheidenden Potenziale systematisch trainieren.

English | 14 Jan. 2014 | ISBN: 1349847992, 1137572442 | 233 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.04 MB

Redefining Well-Being in Nations and Organizations is an essential book for researchers, policy makers and managers. It provides a new multi-disciplinary perspective on wellbeing and engagement, reviewing the latest research from several previously unrelated disciplines to develop a process for active committed enthusiasm (PACE), encompassing theory and clarifying the definitions of, and relationships between, wellbeing, engagement and related concepts. PACE allows researchers to model causal relationships, and policy makers and managers to analyze the potential impact of possible interventions. It demonstrates that, as nations, organizations and individuals fulfil their basic material needs, the impact of individual optimism, and other aspects of positive psychology, become paramount in maximizing wellbeing and engagement.

Frackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment by Wenonah Hauter
2016 | ISBN: 1620970074 | English | 384 pages | PDF | 9 MB

Over the past decade a new and controversial energy extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has rocketed to the forefront of U.S. energy production. With fracking, millions of gallons of water, dangerous chemicals, and sand are injected under high pressure deep into the earth, fracturing hard rock to release oil and gas.

Wenonah Hauter, one of the nation’s leading public interest advocates, argues that the rush to fracking is dangerous to the environment and treacherous to human health. Frackopoly describes how the fracking industry began; the technologies that make it possible; and the destruction and poisoning of clean water sources and the release of harmful radiation from deep inside shale deposits, creating what the author calls sacrifice zones” across the American landscape.

The book also examines the powerful interests that have supported fracking, including leading environmental groups, and offers a thorough debunking of its supposed economic benefits. With a wealth of new data, Frackopoly is essential and riveting reading for anyone interested in protecting the environment and ensuring a healthy and sustainable future for all Americans.

Springer | Business & Management | July 8 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319389734 | 318 pages | pdf | 5.86 mb

Editors: D'Ascenzo, F., Magni, M., Lazazzara, A., Za, S. (Eds.)
Highlights a collection of multidisciplinary contributions in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation
Presents an overview of the research methods currently applied by the broader community of IS scholars
Outlines the most relevant research topics in the field of Information Systems and Digital Innovation

This book examines the impact of digital innovation on organizations. It reveals how the digital revolution is redefining traditional levels of analysis while at the same time blurring the internal and external boundaries of the organizational environment. It presents a collection of research papers that examine the interaction between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and behavior from a threefold perspective: First, they analyze individual behavior in terms of specific organizational practices like learning, collaboration and knowledge transfer, as well as the use of ICT within the organization. Second, they explore the dynamics at work on the border between the internal and the external environments by analyzing the organizational impact of ICT usage outside the company, as can be seen in employer branding, consumer behavior and organizational image. Third, they investigate how ICT is being adopted to help face societal challenges outside the company like waste and pollution, smart cities, and e-government. 
The diversity of views offered makes this book particularly relevant for users, companies, scientists and governments. The content is based on a selection of the best papers – original double-blind peer reviewed contributions –presented at the annual conference of the Italian chapter of AIS, which took place in Rome, Italy, in October 2015, or in other reputable international peer-refereed Information Systems conferences.

Greek Capitalism in Crisis: Marxist Analyses by Stavros Mavroudeas
English | 2014 | ISBN: 041574492X | 262 pages | PDF | 1,2 MB

Despite the depth of the Greek crisis, the exorbitant burdens placed upon the working people and the massive popular resistance movement to capitalist policies, there is a definite lack of consistently Marxist analyses of the Greek problem. International debates regarding the Greek crisis have been dominated by orthodox (Neoclassical and neo-Keynesian) approaches.

The heterodox side of these debates has been occupied by Radical Political Economy approaches (usually radical post-Keynesian or Marxo-Keynesian perspectives). Moreover, they are dominated by the ‘financialisation’ thesis which is quite alien to Marxism, neglects the sphere of production and professes that the global crisis is simply a financial crisis that has nothing to do with ‘real’ accumulation and the profit rate.

This book argues that by emphasising the sphere of production and profitability, classical Marxist analysis better explains the Greek crisis than its orthodox and heterodox competitors. The contributors present critiques of the prevalent approaches and offer studies of the Greek crisis that use the methodology and the analytical and empirical tools of classical Marxist Political Economy. In particular, it is shown that the Greek crisis was caused by falling profitability and the ensuing overaccumulation crisis. The ‘broad unequal exchange’ existing between the euro-center and the euro-periphery contributed to Greek capital’s falling profitability. This book enriches the debate about the Greek economic crisis by demonstrating the insights that can be drawn by considering the Marxist alternative to the dominant mainstream and heterodox approaches.

While financial systems are a key factor in economic growth, there is still surprisingly little agreement about how to define and measure their development. To address this gap, the World Economic Forum has undertaken a research initiative aimed at providing business leaders and policymakers with a common framework to identify and discuss the key factors in the development of global financial systems and markets.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction: The End of Capital and the Transition to Socialism by Daniel E. Saros
English | 2014 | ISBN: 0415742927 | 292 pages | PDF | 1 MB

The failure of command central planning in the twentieth century has led to a general disillusionment within the socialist movement worldwide. Some alternatives to capitalism have been proposed since the end of the Cold War, but none has offered an alternative form of economic calculation. 

This book explains how modern information technology may be used to implement a new method of economic calculation that could bring an end to capitalism and make socialism possible.

In this book, the author critically examines a number of socialist proposals that have been put forward since the end of the Cold War. It is shown that although these proposals have many merits, their inability effectively to incorporate the benefits of information technology into their models has limited their ability to solve the problem of socialist construction. The final section of the book proposes an entirely new model of socialist development, based on a "needs profile" that makes it possible to convert the needs of large numbers of people into data that can be used as a guide for resource allocation. This analysis makes it possible to rethink and carefully specify the conditions necessary for the abolition of capital and consequently the requirements for socialist revolution and, ultimately, communist society.

Information Technology and Socialist Construction will be of interest to students and scholars of political economy, the history of economic thought, labour economics and industrial economics.

736 <--> Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics
http://nitroflare.com/view/F90EB0CEB4654F0/0873896483.pdf


James L Lamprecht, "Applied Data Analysis For Process Improvement: A Practical Guide To Six Sigma Black Belt Statistics" 
2005 | ISBN-10: 0873896483 | 304 pages | PDF | 2 MB

With the rise of Six Sigma, the use of statistics to analyze and improve processes has once again regained a prominent place in businesses around the world. An increasing number of employees and managers, bestowed with the titles Green Belt, Black Belt, or even Master Black Belts, are asked to apply statistical techniques to analyze and resolve industrial and non-industrial (also known as transactional) problems. These individuals are continuously faced with the daunting task of sorting out the vast array of sophisticated techniques placed at their disposal by an equally impressive array of statistical computer software packages. 

This book is intended for the ever-growing number of certified Black Belts as well as uncertified others that would like to understand how data can be analyzed. Many courses, including Six Sigma Black Belt courses, do a good job introducing participants to a vast array of sophisticated statistical techniques in as little as ten days, leaning heavily on statistical software packages. Although it is true that one can simplify statistical principles, learning how to interpret results produced by any statistical software requires the understanding of statistics that this book concisely provides. 

Benefits: 

Numerous examples illustrate how various techniques are applied. 

Each example is reviewed from the perspective of what was not said in the example; in other words, the very information you will be faced with when you conduct your own analysis. 

Titles of some sections in the book include the word optional or advanced. These sections cover more advanced but nonetheless useful topics, but skipping these sections will not affect the overall flow of the various subjects presented.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks (Financial Markets and Investments) by H. Kent Baker and Greg Filbeck
English | 2015 | ISBN: 0199375879 | 624 pages | PDF | 5 MB

During the past few decades, private equity (PE) has attracted considerable attention from investors, practitioners, and academicians. In fact, a substantial literature on PE has emerged. PE offers benefits for institutional and private wealth management clients including diversification and enhancement of risk-adjusted returns. However, several factors such as liquidity concerns, regulatory restrictions, and the lack of transparency limit the attractiveness of some PE options to investors. The latest volume in the Financial Markets and Investments Series, Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks offers a synthesis of the theoretical and empirical literature on PE in both emerging and developed markets. Editors H. Kent Baker, Greg Filbeck, Halil Kiymaz and their co-authors examine PE and provide important insights about topics such as major types of PE (venture capital, leveraged buyouts, mezzanine capital, and distressed debt investments), how PE works, performance and measurement, uses and structure, and trends in the market. Readers can gain an in-depth understanding about PE from academics and practitioners from around the world.

Private Equity: Opportunities and Risks provides a fresh look at the intriguing yet complex subject of PE. A group of experts takes readers through the core topics and issues of PE, and also examines the latest trends and cutting-edge developments in the field. The coverage extends from discussing basic concepts and their application to increasingly complex and real-world situations. This new and intriguing examination of PE is essential reading for anyone hoping to gain a better understanding of PE, from seasoned professionals to those aspiring to enter the demanding world of finance.

Alexandra Kloß zeigt auf, welche Faktoren die wegweisende Entscheidung der Studienwahl beeinflussen. Sie analysiert sowohl soziale Determinanten, wie die Anzahl der Geschwister, die Familienkonstellation und insbesondere die soziale Herkunft, als auch institutionelle Einflussfaktoren, wie Studienfinanzierungsmodelle, Studiengebühren oder auch Zulassungsbeschränkungen. Die unterschiedlichen Aspekte der Fragestellung werden anhand eigens erhobener Umfragedaten in Thüringen sowie der Datensätze des NEPS und des Studierendensurveys in 11 Wellen untersucht. Dabei wird deutlich, dass die Studienwahl viel weniger vom eigenen Willen geprägt ist, als man annehmen mag.

When the Money Runs Out: The End of Western Affluence by Stephen D. King
English | 2013 | ISBN: 0300190522, 0300205236 | 304 pages | EPUB | 0,4 MB

The Western world has experienced extraordinary economic progress throughout the last six decades, a prosperous period so extended that continuous economic growth has come to seem normal. But such an era of continuously rising living standards is a historical anomaly, economist Stephen D. King warns, and the current stagnation of Western economies threatens to reach crisis proportions in the not-so-distant future.

Praised for the “dose of realism” he provided in his book Losing Control, King follows up in this volume with a plain-spoken assessment of where the West stands today. It’s not just the end of an age of affluence, he shows. We have made promises to ourselves that are achievable only through ongoing economic expansion. The future benefits we expect—pensions, healthcare, and social security, for example—may be larger than tomorrow’s resources. And if we reach that point, which promises will be broken and who will lose out? The lessons of history offer compelling evidence that political and social upheaval are often born of economic stagnation. King addresses these lessons with a multifaceted plan that involves painful—but necessary—steps toward a stable and just economic future.

Consumer Energy Conservation Behavior After Fukushima: Evidence from Field Experiments (SpringerBriefs in Economics) by Isamu Matsukawa
English | 23 May 2016 | ISBN: 981101096X | 120 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.45 MB

This book presents an in-depth empirical analysis of consumer response to alternative policies for energy conservation. Its main focus is on innovative policy instruments that have attracted increasing attention from academics and energy conservation practitioners alike: critical peak pricing, conservation requests, in-home displays, and home energy reports. The book investigates the effects of these policy instruments on residential demand for electricity. The data is drawn from a series of randomized field experiments for the years 2012–2013 in Japan, where serious concerns about power shortages have emerged in the wake of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. By applying econometric techniques to the quantitative analysis of residential power consumption, the book demonstrates how consumers respond to innovative instruments for energy conservation. It also offers new perspectives on how these instruments can be used more effectively and explores the potential for their practical implementation. This highly informative book is essential reading for energy specialists in both academic and professional contexts.

Employer Branding für KMU: Die Bedeutung internationaler Kontakte bei der Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften (BestMasters) by David Vinzenz Hanußek
German | 24 Dec. 2015 | ISBN: 3658118342 | 184 Pages | PDF (True) | 6.32 MB

David Hanußek erforscht die Bedeutung von internationalen Kontakten und die Kreation einer Arbeitgebermarke für die Gewinnung von Arbeitskräften in kleineren und mittleren Unternehmen (KMU). Auf Grundlage von Umfragen bei Arbeitgebern in der Region Nordschwarzwald zeigt er, dass die Attraktivität eines Arbeitgebers vor allem von dessen Flexibilität in der Gestaltung des Arbeitsumfeldes und dessen Innovationsfähigkeit abhängt. Gerade KMU haben oft nicht die Mittel, sich mit einer Arbeitgebermarke auch international richtig zu positionieren. Im Wettbewerb um Arbeitskräfte ist daher die Region entscheidend: Politik, Tourismus- und Stadtmarketing, Industrie-, Handels- sowie Handwerkskammern sollten hier Hand in Hand arbeiten, um über die Region und die Gesamtheit der Unternehmen auch das einzelne Unternehmen attraktiv zu machen.

Personalgewinnung in Zeiten des Fachkräftemangels: Quereinsteiger als potenzielle Kandidaten entdecken by Sylvia Knecht
German | 3 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3658131632 | 180 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.33 MB

Dieses Buch zeigt, dass Quereinsteiger für Unternehmen bisher wenig erkannte Leistungsbringer sein können. In Politik und im Ehrenamt sind sie bereits an der Tagesordnung. In der Wirtschaft fehlt es aber nach wie vor an Mut, Wissen und Können, Bewerber unabhängig von bisher erbrachten Leistungsnachweisen zu beurteilen.

Die Autorin zeigt auf, warum sich dies ändern muss, welche Chancen sich bieten, wenn grundlegend neue Denkmuster zugelassen werden und wie man Quereinsteiger in Bewerbungsverfahren aktiv anspricht.

Und umgekehrt müssen sich die Quereinsteiger auch auf die Belange der Unternehmen einlassen. Getreu dem Motto: Der Kunde kauft nur, was er braucht, muss alles optimal auf die Bedürfnisse der potenziellen ‚Kundschaft‘ ausgerichtet werden. Dazu finden sich praktische Tipps und Anregungen, die helfen, schneller ins Unternehmen einzusteigen. 

Rund 1,2 Millionen Menschen wagen jährlich in Deutschland den Sprung in die berufliche Neuorientierung. Diese Quereinsteiger überzeugen durch neue Denkansätze, Motivation und Eigeninitiative.

· Quereinsteiger richtig rekrutieren: Tipps und Tricks für die Personalabteilung

The Himalayan Border Region: Trade, Identity and Mobility in Kumaon, India (Advances in Asian Human-Environmental Research) by Christoph Bergmann
English | 5 May 2016 | ISBN: 3319297058 | 208 Pages | PDF (True) | 3.98 MB

Drawing from extensive archival work and long-term ethnographic research, this book focuses on the so-called Bhotiyas, former trans-Himalayan traders and a Scheduled Tribe of India who reside in several high valleys of the Kumaon Himalaya. The area is located in the border triangle between India, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR, People’s Republic of China), and Nepal, where contestations over political boundaries have created multiple challenges as well as opportunities for local mountain communities. Based on an analytical framework that is grounded in and contributes to recent advances in the field of border studies, the author explores how the Bhotiyas have used their agency to develop a flourishing trans-Himalayan trade under British colonial influence; to assert an identity and win legal recognition as a tribal community in the political setup of independent India; and to innovate their pastoral mobility in the context of ongoing state and market reforms. By examining the Bhotiyas’ trade, identity and mobility this book shows how and why the Himalayan border region has evolved as an agentive site of political action for a variety of different actors.
