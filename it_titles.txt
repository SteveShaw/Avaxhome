Prior Processes and Their Applications: Nonparametric Bayesian Estimation, Second Edition
Springer | Statistics | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319327887 | 327 pages | pdf | 3.14 mb

Authors: Phadia, Eswar G.
Presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes
Provides valuable resource for nonparametric Bayesian analysis of big data
Includes a section on machine learning
Shows practical examples

This book presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes that have been developed over the past four decades for dealing with Bayesian approach to solving selected nonparametric inference problems. This revised edition has been substantially expanded to reflect the current interest in this area. After an overview of different prior processes, it examines the now pre-eminent Dirichlet process and its variants including hierarchical processes, then addresses new processes such as dependent Dirichlet, local Dirichlet, time-varying and spatial processes, all of which exploit the countable mixture representation of the Dirichlet process. It subsequently discusses various neutral to right type processes, including gamma and extended gamma, beta and beta-Stacy processes, and then describes the Chinese Restaurant, Indian Buffet and infinite gamma-Poisson processes, which prove to be very useful in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval and featural modeling. Tailfree and Polya tree and their extensions form a separate chapter, while the last two chapters present the Bayesian solutions to certain estimation problems pertaining to the distribution function and its functional based on complete data as well as right censored data. Because of the conjugacy property of some of these processes, most solutions are presented in closed form.
However, the current interest in modeling and treating large-scale and complex data also poses a problem – the posterior distribution, which is essential to Bayesian analysis, is invariably not in a closed form, making it necessary to resort to simulation. Accordingly, the book also introduces several computational procedures, such as the Gibbs sampler, Blocked Gibbs sampler and slice sampling, highlighting essential steps of algorithms while discussing specific models. In addition, it features crucial steps of proofs and derivations, explains the relationships between different processes and provides further clarifications to promote a deeper understanding. Lastly, it includes a comprehensive list of references, equipping readers to explore further on their own.

Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R By Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson
2009 | 449 Pages | ISBN: 1420068725 | PDF | 8 MB


Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.

In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms
• What the standard string class provides and how to use it
• What functionality the library provides for file and stream-based I/O
• What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks
• How to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the C++11 threading libraries

https://filejoker.net/43vu20mavl4m


Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system. It is an excellent reference for scientific computations to solve real-world problems using a comprehensive stack of open-source Java libraries included in the DataMelt (DMelt) project and will be appreciated by many data-analysis scientists, engineers and students.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Dr. Fatih Nayebi, "Swift 3 Functional Programming"
English | ISBN: 1785883887 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB/MOBI | 296 pages | 4 MB/3 MB/4 MB

Bring the power of Swift functional programming to iOS, OS X and Web development to build clean, smart and reliable applications

About This Book
Written for Swift 3, this is a comprehensive guide that introduces iOS and OS X developers to the all-new world of functional programming that has so far been alien to them
Learn about first-class functions and how imperative-style patterns can be converted into functional code using some simple techniques
The book will get you familiar with using functional programming alongside existing OOP techniques so you can get the best of both worlds and develop clean, robust code
Who This Book Is For
The book is for iOS, Web, and macOS developers with a basic knowledge of Swift programming that are interested in learning functional programming paradigms

What You Will Learn
First-class, higher-order, and pure functions
Closures and capturing values
Custom operators, recursion, and memoization
Value and reference types in Swift
Enumerations, algebraic data types, patterns, and pattern matching
Generics and associated type protocols
Higher-order functions such as map, flatMap filter, and reduce
Dealing with optionals, fmap, and apply for multiple functional mapping
Functional data structures such as Semigroup, Monoid, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Stack, and Lazy List
Immutability, copy constructors, and lenses
Combining FP paradigms with OOP, FRP, and POP in your day-to-day development activities
Developing a backend application with Swift
Developing an iOS application with FP, OOP, FRP, and POP paradigms

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

Linux systems are everywhere today, even in companies once considered "pure Windows." If you’re a sysadmin, network administrator, or developer in a small Windows shop, you may have to jump in and fix a system problem when your site goes down. What if you have no Linux knowledge? This short guide provides tips to help you survive.

Linux systems may appear in your shop as virtual machines or in the cloud, including web servers, databases, mobile device managers, version control, and monitoring systems. When one of them falters, this primer leads you through some diagnostic and recovery tasks so you can quickly get your site back up.
Connect to a Linux system with OpenSSH and PuTTY secure shells
List files and directories, and move around within the file system
Safely inspect the file contents without changing them
Narrow your search by using commands to locate specific files
Use the grep command to search for error messages inside a file
Determine real-time system state to find underlying problems
Examine disk utilization and zero in on space-hogging files
Transfer suspect files from Linux to Windows for later analysis
Use commands to start, stop, restart, or even kill unresponsive services
Know where to find help when troubleshooting isn’t enough

Jim Lehmer has worked with computer systems for over three decades. He’s been involved with software development in various roles, including programmer, systems programmer, software engineer, team lead, and architect.

Linear Algebra for Computational Sciences and Engineering
Springer | Theoretical Computer Science | Aug 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403397 | 464 pages | pdf | 8.5 mb

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Clojure Reactive Programming By Leonardo Borges
2015 | 232 Pages | ISBN: 1783986662 | EPUB, MOBI, PDF | 15 MB


Reactive Programming (RP) is central to many concurrent systems. It endeavors to make the process of developing highly-concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications simpler and less error-prone. RP comes in many flavors and we will look at some of them in this book. Clojure Reactive Programming is a practical guide aimed at exploring RP. It starts by describing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and its formulations, as well as how it inspired Compositional Event Systems (CES). It also presents several examples of Reactive applications implemented in different frameworks, allowing you to develop an understanding of the subject as well as learn how to develop your ability to work with time-varying values. By the end of the book, you will be equipped to solve real-world problems and have a clear understanding of when and how you should use different the approaches that are shown in the book.

Learn to use Python for analyzing data and trade in Stock Markets

There are so many different trading or investing approaches as people in the market.

Many existing tools support the most common ones, but if you really want to success with an innovative practice, you have to build it on your own.

Due to its characteristics, Python is being adopted by the financial industry as its reference programming language.

But Python is not expensive as other financials tools are, in fact it is completely free. And it is not difficult to learn. So, why don't give it a try?

Learn how to apply Python to Trading and Investing with this Hands-on Course.

Ipython Working Environment
Main Data Analysis Python Libraries
How to import/export Financial Data
Data Munging
Customized Charts
Different Projects applying this knowledge
Improve your Programming and Investing Skills at a time.

Either if you can already program and are interested in Finance. Or if you are already a Finance practitioner and are interested in applying programming to your career. This is a course for you.

In addition to using this new knowledge for your own investments, new opportunities will widely open up for you if you are able to combine these two disciplines.

The volume of data is increasing at not seen before rates. And new algorithms and tools are needed to get the most of it. It is difficult to imagine a more promising skill in your career path than learning to manage and analyze data through programming.

Content and Overview

This course will start with a review of main Python libraries to use for Data Analysis.

Although due to the readability of Python it is not necessary to have previous knowledge of it. It is recommended at least to have a previous contact with it.

The main goal is to focus in the application of it to Finance concepts. So not much time will be addressed to common functions or data structures. You will be able, anyway, to send any doubt to the Instructor and if necessary new lectures will be upload replying most frequently asked questions.

The best way to learn is doing. So in the second part of the course, actual applications with the complete code will be developed. You will be able to test and modify them with your desired parameters or strategies and even propose new ones. Building, in this way, a community around the course that will help us to grow up individually.

New projects will be added periodically in the future, but the course price will go up accordingly. So enroll now, It will be your best investment.

July 2016 | MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 3Hours 49M | 389 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Puppet is and has been the de-facto configuration management in Linux and Unix systems. With Puppet 4, it is even bigger and stronger and this course teaches you how to make best use of the Puppet language.

As your server estate grows with more and more virtual systems, so does the difficulty of trying to keep your configurations consistent and reliable. The days of having a few servers to manage are long-gone, and there seems to be an array of different distributions that all require specific tools. Puppet is a mature and respected configuration management tool that is available free of charge as open-source software. In this course, Puppet 4: Language Essentials, you can learn Puppet quickly as the language is written simply with administrators and not developers in mind. First you'll learn how to provide consistent and reliable configuration results, and look at defining configurations as resources. Next, you'll learn to use logic to set the correct service names. Finally you'll be looking at how to restart services after configuration changes. After watching this course, you'll be able to create manifests yourself as well as defining your own configuration needs.

Handbook of Robust Low-Rank and Sparse Matrix Decomposition: Applications in Image and Video Processing shows you how robust subspace learning and tracking by decomposition into low-rank and sparse matrices provide a suitable framework for computer vision applications. Incorporating both existing and new ideas, the book conveniently gives you one-stop access to a number of different decompositions, algorithms, implementations, and benchmarking techniques.

Divided into five parts, the book begins with an overall introduction to robust principal component analysis (PCA) via decomposition into low-rank and sparse matrices. The second part addresses robust matrix factorization/completion problems while the third part focuses on robust online subspace estimation, learning, and tracking. Covering applications in image and video processing, the fourth part discusses image analysis, image denoising, motion saliency detection, video coding, key frame extraction, and hyperspectral video processing. The final part presents resources and applications in background/foreground separation for video surveillance.

With contributions from leading teams around the world, this handbook provides a complete overview of the concepts, theories, algorithms, and applications related to robust low-rank and sparse matrix decompositions. It is designed for researchers, developers, and graduate students in computer vision, image and video processing, real-time architecture, machine learning, and data mining.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Complete course to learn Node.JS with integrated with Elasticsearch, Redis, AngularJS, Yeoman, Grunt, PassportJS, etc…

As you know, Javascript popularity increased tremendously last couple of years. One of the biggest reason is NodeJS. This course aims to teach NodeJS and third party applications from zero to expert level. You will not just learn Hello World project, you will learn What is Blocking, Non-Blocking I/O, Event Loop Mechanism, how is node.js used in real life by interacting other popular technologies and modules like;

Elasticsearch: You will cover Elasticsearch basics, how to use this in order to provide full text search mechanism to your application.

MongoDB: Store your data in to db, and make json queries to this document based database

PassportJS: You will also learn PassportJS to construct authentication system in your application. You will be able to restrict some endpoints by using internal PassportJS properties

ExpressJS: During this course, you will develop complete two web applications. ExpressJS is for developing controllers, communicate this controllers with views, and provide some db interactions by using ORM frameworks like MongooseJS

IronCache: Do you want to make your application faster? You can cache your data to IronCache (Cache as a service) in this lecture also

IronMQ: You will be able to use message queue system by using IronMQ in NodeJS.

SocketIO: Converting your application into realtime application

Well, you will do full stack development in this course. That means, you will be able to develop frontend application with AngularJS by Yeoman, Grunt, Bower. This forntend application will communicate with rest service devloped in this course again.

Yeoman: You will be generating your frontend application with this

Grunt: Your application tasks will be managed and executed by using Grunt

Bower: Tired of using lots of third party js frameworks and deal with conflict, let Bower do that for you

After completing two beautiful application, you will deploy your application into Heroku.

I can give guarantee about becoming expert in NodeJS and related technologies by taking this course. We will do lots of best practices about each technology, and develop examples progressively. Also, at the end of each section, you will be provided Quiz for specific section. Although, this course is a complete reference to NodeJS and related technologies, you can require extra video tutorials for any topic related to NodeJS in order to clearify question marks in your mind. I will publish them in Wishes section.

56 <--> C++ Standard Library Quick Reference
http://nitroflare.com/view/EB87697BE254871/1484218752.epub


C++ Standard Library Quick Reference by Peter Van Weert, Marc Gregoire
2016 | ISBN: 1484218752 | English | 206 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

This quick reference is a condensed reference guide to the essential data structures, algorithms, and functions provided by the C++ Standard Library. More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The C++ Standard Library Quick Reference features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms
• What the standard string class provides and how to use it
• What functionality the library provides for file and stream-based I/O
• What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks
• How to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the C++11 threading libraries

http://nitroflare.com/view/1D833D2A0645938/3319285297_Numeric.pdf
https://filejoker.net/43vu20mavl4m


Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system. It is an excellent reference for scientific computations to solve real-world problems using a comprehensive stack of open-source Java libraries included in the DataMelt (DMelt) project and will be appreciated by many data-analysis scientists, engineers and students.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Dr. Fatih Nayebi, "Swift 3 Functional Programming"
English | ISBN: 1785883887 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB/MOBI | 296 pages | 4 MB/3 MB/4 MB

Bring the power of Swift functional programming to iOS, OS X and Web development to build clean, smart and reliable applications

About This Book
Written for Swift 3, this is a comprehensive guide that introduces iOS and OS X developers to the all-new world of functional programming that has so far been alien to them
Learn about first-class functions and how imperative-style patterns can be converted into functional code using some simple techniques
The book will get you familiar with using functional programming alongside existing OOP techniques so you can get the best of both worlds and develop clean, robust code
Who This Book Is For
The book is for iOS, Web, and macOS developers with a basic knowledge of Swift programming that are interested in learning functional programming paradigms

What You Will Learn
First-class, higher-order, and pure functions
Closures and capturing values
Custom operators, recursion, and memoization
Value and reference types in Swift
Enumerations, algebraic data types, patterns, and pattern matching
Generics and associated type protocols
Higher-order functions such as map, flatMap filter, and reduce
Dealing with optionals, fmap, and apply for multiple functional mapping
Functional data structures such as Semigroup, Monoid, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Stack, and Lazy List
Immutability, copy constructors, and lenses
Combining FP paradigms with OOP, FRP, and POP in your day-to-day development activities
Developing a backend application with Swift
Developing an iOS application with FP, OOP, FRP, and POP paradigms

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

Linux systems are everywhere today, even in companies once considered "pure Windows." If you’re a sysadmin, network administrator, or developer in a small Windows shop, you may have to jump in and fix a system problem when your site goes down. What if you have no Linux knowledge? This short guide provides tips to help you survive.

Linux systems may appear in your shop as virtual machines or in the cloud, including web servers, databases, mobile device managers, version control, and monitoring systems. When one of them falters, this primer leads you through some diagnostic and recovery tasks so you can quickly get your site back up.
Connect to a Linux system with OpenSSH and PuTTY secure shells
List files and directories, and move around within the file system
Safely inspect the file contents without changing them
Narrow your search by using commands to locate specific files
Use the grep command to search for error messages inside a file
Determine real-time system state to find underlying problems
Examine disk utilization and zero in on space-hogging files
Transfer suspect files from Linux to Windows for later analysis
Use commands to start, stop, restart, or even kill unresponsive services
Know where to find help when troubleshooting isn’t enough

Jim Lehmer has worked with computer systems for over three decades. He’s been involved with software development in various roles, including programmer, systems programmer, software engineer, team lead, and architect.

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Learn to use Python for analyzing data and trade in Stock Markets

There are so many different trading or investing approaches as people in the market.

Many existing tools support the most common ones, but if you really want to success with an innovative practice, you have to build it on your own.

Due to its characteristics, Python is being adopted by the financial industry as its reference programming language.

But Python is not expensive as other financials tools are, in fact it is completely free. And it is not difficult to learn. So, why don't give it a try?

Learn how to apply Python to Trading and Investing with this Hands-on Course.

Ipython Working Environment
Main Data Analysis Python Libraries
How to import/export Financial Data
Data Munging
Customized Charts
Different Projects applying this knowledge
Improve your Programming and Investing Skills at a time.

Either if you can already program and are interested in Finance. Or if you are already a Finance practitioner and are interested in applying programming to your career. This is a course for you.

In addition to using this new knowledge for your own investments, new opportunities will widely open up for you if you are able to combine these two disciplines.

The volume of data is increasing at not seen before rates. And new algorithms and tools are needed to get the most of it. It is difficult to imagine a more promising skill in your career path than learning to manage and analyze data through programming.

Content and Overview

This course will start with a review of main Python libraries to use for Data Analysis.

Although due to the readability of Python it is not necessary to have previous knowledge of it. It is recommended at least to have a previous contact with it.

The main goal is to focus in the application of it to Finance concepts. So not much time will be addressed to common functions or data structures. You will be able, anyway, to send any doubt to the Instructor and if necessary new lectures will be upload replying most frequently asked questions.

The best way to learn is doing. So in the second part of the course, actual applications with the complete code will be developed.
