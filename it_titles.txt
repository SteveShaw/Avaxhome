This textbook on practical data analytics unites fundamental principles, algorithms, and data. Algorithms are the keystone of data analytics and the focal point of this textbook. Clear and intuitive explanations of the mathematical and statistical foundations make the algorithms transparent. But practical data analytics requires more than just the foundations. Problems and data are enormously variable and only the most elementary of algorithms can be used without modification. Programming fluency and experience with real and challenging data is indispensable and so the reader is immersed in Python and R and real data analysis. By the end of the book, the reader will have gained the ability to adapt algorithms to new problems and carry out innovative analyses.
This book has three parts:
(a) Data Reduction: Begins with the concepts of data reduction, data maps, and information extraction. The second chapter introduces associative statistics, the mathematical foundation of scalable algorithms and distributed computing. Practical aspects of distributed computing is the subject of the Hadoop and MapReduce chapter.
(b) Extracting Information from Data: Linear regression and data visualization are the principal topics of Part II. The authors dedicate a chapter to the critical domain of Healthcare Analytics for an extended example of practical data analytics. The algorithms and analytics will be of much interest to practitioners interested in utilizing the large and unwieldly data sets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
© Predictive Analytics Two foundational and widely used algorithms, k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes, are developed in detail. A chapter is dedicated to forecasting. The last chapter focuses on streaming data and uses publicly accessible data streams originating from the Twitter API and the NASDAQ stock market in the tutorials.
This book is intended for a one- or two-semester course in data analytics for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The prerequisites are kept low, and students with one or two courses in probability or statistics, an exposure to vectors and matrices, and a programming course will have no difficulty. The core material of every chapter is accessible to all with these prerequisites. The chapters often expand at the close with innovations of interest to practitioners of data science. Each chapter includes exercises of varying levels of difficulty. The text is eminently suitable for self-study and an exceptional resource for practitioners.

Jacob Zimmerman, "Python Descriptors" 
2017 | ISBN-10: 148422504X | 64 pages | PDF | 1 MB

This short book on Python descriptors is a collection of knowledge and ideas from many sources on dealing with and creating descriptors. And, after going through the things all descriptors have in common, the author explores ideas that have multiple ways of being implemented as well as completely new ideas never seen elsewhere before.

This truly is a comprehensive guide to creating Python descriptors. As a bonus: A pip install-able library, descriptor_tools, was written alongside this book and is an open source library on GitHub.

There aren't many good resources out there for writing Python descriptors, and extremely few books. This is a sad state of affairs, as it makes it difficult for Python developers to get a really good understanding of how descriptors work and the techniques to avoid the big gotchas associated with working with them.

What You Will Learn
Discover descriptor protocols
Master attribute access and how it applies to descriptors
Make descriptors and discover why you should
Store attributes
Create read-only descriptors and _delete()
Explore the descriptor classes
Apply the other uses of descriptors and more

English | 2013 | ISBN: 1568817258 | 372 pages | PDF | 294 MB

To achieve the complex task of interpreting what we see, our brains rely on statistical regularities and patterns in visual data. Knowledge of these regularities can also be considerably useful in visual computing disciplines, such as computer vision, computer graphics, and image processing. The field of natural image statistics studies the regularities to exploit their potential and better understand human vision. With numerous color figures throughout, Image Statistics in Visual Computing covers all aspects of natural image statistics, from data collection to analysis to applications in computer graphics, computational photography, image processing, and art.

The authors keep the material accessible, providing mathematical definitions where appropriate to help readers understand the transforms that highlight statistical regularities present in images. The book also describes patterns that arise once the images are transformed and gives examples of applications that have successfully used statistical regularities. Numerous references enable readers to easily look up more information about a specific concept or application. A supporting website also offers additional information, including descriptions of various image databases suitable for statistics.

Collecting state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary knowledge in one source, this book explores the relation of natural image statistics to human vision and shows how natural image statistics can be applied to visual computing. It encourages readers in both academic and industrial settings to develop novel insights and applications in all disciplines that relate to visual computing.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Take this course to learn how to code a fully functional keylogger in C++ for use in Windows!

If you want to learn to code at an advanced level in C++ or build your own fully functional advanced keylogger from scratch for learning ethical hacking, I think you might love this course! In this course you will see exactly how to create an advanced keylogger starting from nothing by literally following the steps I take as I make it!

This keylogger is capable of recording all the keyboard and mouse input! It can even record independent of the language settings because it logs the physical keys on the keyboard first. Next, by using an arbitrary keymap with human friendly names, it translates the machine keys to something that we can understand. It also possesses mail sending capabilities so you can just schedule the logfile to be sent via mail, lets say every 12 hours. In addition to this, it will also keep the logfile encrypted. Therefore, we will create another program which will be able to decrypt the logfile on your end.

For learning C++, this is an ideal course because it is completely hands on learning that provides a functional end product! Some future features that will be added to the keylogger course as I develop them will include but are not limited to taking screenshots, capturing clipboard content (copy-paste), recording website URLs, and so on! Take this course now to get immediate access to the videos and to get answers to every single question you ask in the course!

As an information technology professional myself, I realize what the final product of this course is capable of. I trust in creating this that you will use it for good and for learning. If you choose to use this keylogger for any illegal or immoral purposes, you risk losing a lot. This is only for educational purposes. The keylogger that you are going to see will be able to cause some serious damage, so please use it in a legal and responsible way.

298 <--> Optical Flow and Trajectory Estimation Methods


Joel Gibson, "Optical Flow and Trajectory Estimation Methods" 
English | ISBN: 3319449400 | 2016 | 49 pages | PDF | 1 MB

This brief focuses on two main problems in the domain of optical flow and trajectory estimation: (i) The problem of finding convex optimization methods to apply sparsity to optical flow; and (ii) The problem of how to extend sparsity to improve trajectories in a computationally tractable way.

Beginning with a review of optical flow fundamentals, it discusses the commonly used flow estimation strategies and the advantages or shortcomings of each. The brief also introduces the concepts associated with sparsity including dictionaries and low rank matrices. Next, it provides context for optical flow and trajectory methods including algorithms, data sets, and performance measurement. The second half of the brief covers sparse regularization of total variation optical flow and robust low rank trajectories. The authors describe a new approach that uses partially-overlapping patches to accelerate the calculation and is implemented in a coarse-to-fine strategy. Experimental results show that combining total variation and a sparse constraint from a learned dictionary is more effective than employing total variation alone.

The brief is targeted at researchers and practitioners in the fields of engineering and computer science. It caters particularly to new researchers looking for cutting edge topics in optical flow as well as veterans of optical flow wishing to learn of the latest advances in multi-frame methods.

This guide for practicing statisticians, data scientists, and R users and programmers will teach the essentials of preprocessing: data leveraging the R programming language to easily and quickly turn noisy data into usable pieces of information. Data wrangling, which is also commonly referred to as data munging, transformation, manipulation, janitor work, etc., can be a painstakingly laborious process. Roughly 80% of data analysis is spent on cleaning and preparing data; however, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, analysis, reporting), it is essential that one become fluent and efficient in data wrangling techniques.

This book will guide the user through the data wrangling process via a step-by-step tutorial approach and provide a solid foundation for working with data in R. The author's goal is to teach the user how to easily wrangle data in order to spend more time on understanding the content of the data. By the end of the book, the user will have learned: 

How to work with different types of data such as numerics, characters, regular expressions, factors, and dates
The difference between different data structures and how to create, add additional components to, and subset each data structure
How to acquire and parse data from locations previously inaccessible
How to develop functions and use loop control structures to reduce code redundancy
How to use pipe operators to simplify code and make it more readable
How to reshape the layout of data and manipulate, summarize, and join data sets

Streaming provides an efficient way to process data in chunks instead of loading bulk data into an application's memory space. It's almost inevitable that you will need to use streaming in your applications. However, what many developers miss is that there are different pieces to the .NET streaming architecture puzzle. This course will explain this architecture including backing store streams, decorator streams, and stream adapters.
It's almost inevitable that you will need to use streaming in your applications. Yet streaming is one of the most often misunderstood topics. This misunderstanding is the result of the fact that there are multiple elements into the streaming architecture. This course we will cover many of these important elements. We start off with the overall architecture and the common features of all stream types. Then we will move into backing store streams, as well as explaining the different types of these streams. We will then cover another type of stream called decorator streams. Following that we will learn about stream adapters as the mechanism to work with high level data representation instead of bytes. Finally, we will cover how to take advantage of asynchronous operations in .NET streaming.

363 <--> A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python (5th edition)
http://nitroflare.com/view/F3526B9AB7DA186/3662498863.pdf


Hans Petter Langtangen, "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python (5th edition)" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3662498863 | 922 pages | PDF | 9 MB

The book serves as a first introduction to computer programming of scientific applications, using the high-level Python language. The exposition is example and problem-oriented, where the applications are taken from mathematics, numerical calculus, statistics, physics, biology and finance. The book teaches "Matlab-style" and procedural programming as well as object-oriented programming. High school mathematics is a required background and it is advantageous to study classical and numerical one-variable calculus in parallel with reading this book. Besides learning how to program computers, the reader will also learn how to solve mathematical problems, arising in various branches of science and engineering, with the aid of numerical methods and programming. By blending programming, mathematics and scientific applications, the book lays a solid foundation for practicing computational science.

From the reviews: Langtangen … does an excellent job of introducing programming as a set of skills in problem solving. He guides the reader into thinking properly about producing program logic and data structures for modeling real-world problems using objects and functions and embracing the object-oriented paradigm. … Summing Up: Highly recommended. 

F. H. Wild III, Choice, Vol. 47 (8), April 2010

Those of us who have learned scientific programming in Python ‘on the streets’ could be a little jealous of students who have the opportunity to take a course out of Langtangen’s Primer.” 
John D. Cook, The Mathematical Association of America, September 2011

This book goes through Python in particular, and programming in general, via tasks that scientists will likely perform. It contains valuable information for students new to scientific computing and would be the perfect bridge between an introduction to programming and an advanced course on numerical methods or computational science.
Alex Small, IEEE, CiSE Vol. 14 (2), March /April 2012 

“This fourth edition is a wonderful, inclusive textbook that covers pretty much everything one needs to know to go from zero to fairly sophisticated scientific programming in Python…”

English | 2014 | ISBN: 1439873437 | PDF | pages: 283 | 2.0 mb

A Practical Guide to Implementing Nonparametric and Rank-Based Procedures


Nonparametric Statistical Methods Using R covers traditional nonparametric methods and rank-based analyses, including estimation and inference for models ranging from simple location models to general linear and nonlinear models for uncorrelated and correlated responses. The authors emphasize applications and statistical computation. They illustrate the methods with many real and simulated data examples using R, including the packages Rfit and npsm.


The book first gives an overview of the R language and basic statistical concepts before discussing nonparametrics. It presents rank-based methods for one- and two-sample problems, procedures for regression models, computation for general fixed-effects ANOVA and ANCOVA models, and time-to-event analyses. The last two chapters cover more advanced material, including high breakdown fits for general regression models and rank-based inference for cluster correlated data.


The book can be used as a primary text or supplement in a course on applied nonparametric or robust procedures and as a reference for researchers who need to implement nonparametric and rank-based methods in practice. Through numerous examples, it shows readers how to apply these methods using R.

Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, "Deep Learning (draft)" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 0262035618 | 800 pages | PDF | 23 MB

"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." – Elon Musk, co-chair of OpenAI; co-founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX

Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

Genre: Video Training

Learn to program statistical applications and Monte Carlo simulations with numerous "real-life" cases and R software.

R Programming for Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods focuses on using R software to program probabilistic simulations, often called Monte Carlo Simulations. Typical simplified "real-world" examples include simulating the probabilities of a baseball player having a 'streak' of twenty sequential season games with 'hits-at-bat' or estimating the likely total number of taxicabs in a strange city when one observes a certain sequence of numbered cabs pass a particular street corner over a 60 minute period. In addition to detailing half a dozen (sometimes amusing) 'real-world' extended example applications, the course also explains in detail how to use existing R functions, and how to write your own R functions, to perform simulated inference estimates, including likelihoods and confidence intervals, and other cases of stochastic simulation. Techniques to use R to generate different characteristics of various families of random variables are explained in detail. The course teaches skills to implement various approaches to simulate continuous and discrete random variable probability distribution functions, parameter estimation, Monte-Carlo Integration, and variance reduction techniques. The course partially utilizes the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) spuRs package to demonstrate how to structure and write programs to accomplish mathematical and probabilistic simulations using R statistical software.

Support Vectors Machines have become a well established tool within machine learning. They work well in practice and have now been used across a wide range of applications from recognizing hand-written digits, to face identification, text categorisation, bioinformatics, and database marketing. In this book we give an introductory overview of this subject. We start with a simple Support Vector Machine for performing binary classification before considering multi-class classification and learning in the presence of noise. We show that this framework can be extended to many other scenarios such as prediction with real-valued outputs, novelty detection and the handling of complex output structures such as parse trees. Finally, we give an overview of the main types of kernels which are used in practice and how to learn and make predictions from multiple types of input data.

When should you use Python’s built-in data types, and when should you develop your own? In this video course, George Heineman introduces Python programmers to several important data structures and demonstrates their use with example algorithms. Generic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks can solve many problems, but to work through some specialized problems, you need to learn different ways to structure data appropriately.

Many Python programmers learned their skills through non-traditional routes, rather than through an undergraduate computer science degree. This video helps complete your education in fundamental data types step-by-step. For many of the data structures, you’ll write sample code using a variety of existing modules, and define a process that will help you evaluate and assess these modules for use in your own software. All you need to get started is a working knowledge of Python's built-in data types.

Topics include:

Built-in Python data structures
Python standard library types
Design principles for data structures
Data structures and associated algorithm examples

A Tutorial on Elliptic Pde Solvers and Their Parallelization by Craig C. Douglas, Gundolf Haase, Ulrich Langer
Publisher: Society for Industrial & Applied | 2003 | ISBN: 0898715415 | 135 pages | PDF | 13,8 MB

This compact yet thorough tutorial is the perfect introduction to the basic concepts of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using parallel numerical methods. In just eight short chapters, the authors provide readers with enough basic knowledge of PDEs, discretization methods, solution techniques, parallel computers, parallel programming, and the run-time behavior of parallel algorithms to allow them to understand, develop, and implement parallel PDE solvers. Examples throughout the book are intentionally kept simple so that the parallelization strategies are not dominated by technical details. A Tutorial on Elliptic PDE Solvers and Their Parallelization is a valuable aid for learning about the possible errors and bottlenecks in parallel computing. One of the highlights of the tutorial is that the course material can run on a laptop, not just on a parallel computer or cluster of PCs, thus allowing readers to experience their first successes in parallel computing in a relatively short amount of time.

The course assumes you have no prior knowledge of Python, so you also get to learn the basics of Python in the first two sections of the course. However, if you already know Python, the first two sections can serve as a refresher before you jump into the data analysis and visualization part.

In the course you will learn to use Python third-party data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, just to mention a few and tools to boost your productivity such as Spyder and Jupyter.

As you progress through the course, you will be guided step by step on building a program that uses real world data containing hundreds of files and millions of records. You will learn to write Python code that downloads, extracts, cleans, manipulates, aggregates and visualizes these datasets using Python. Apart from following the video screencasts, you will also be required to write your own Python scripts from scratch for completing a data analysis project on income data.

The New Statistics with R: An Introduction for Biologists By Andy Hector
2015 | 224 Pages | ISBN: 0198729057 , 0198729065 | PDF | 34 MB


Statistical methods are a key tool for all scientists working with data, but learning the basic mathematical skills can be one of the most challenging components of a biologist's training. This accessible book provides a contemporary introduction to the classical techniques and modern extensions of linear model analysis: one of the most useful approaches in the analysis of scientific data in the life and environmental sciences. It emphasizes an estimation-based approach that accounts for recent criticisms of the over-use of probability values, and introduces alternative approaches using information criteria. Statistics are introduced through worked analyses performed in R, the free open source programming language for statistics and graphics, which is rapidly becoming the standard software in many areas of science and technology. These analyses use real data sets from ecology, evolutionary biology and environmental science, and the data sets and R scripts are available as support material. The book's structure and user friendly style stem from the author's 20 years of experience teaching statistics to life and environmental scientists at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The New Statistics with R is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students, professional researchers, and practitioners in the fields of ecology, evolution, environmental studies, and computational biology.

Venkat Subramaniam, "Test-Driving JavaScript Applications: Rapid, Confident, Maintainable Code"
English | ISBN: 1680501747 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB | 200 pages | 10 MB/5 MB

Debunk the myth that JavaScript is not easily testable. Whether you use Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, AngularJS, or directly manipulate the DOM, you can test-drive JavaScript. Learn the craft of writing meaningful, deterministic automated tests with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. Test asynchronous JavaScript, decouple and properly mock out dependencies, measure code coverage, and create lightweight modular designs of both server-side and client-side code. Your investment in writing tests will pay high dividends as you create code that's predictable and cost-effective to change.

Design and code JavaScript applications with automated tests. Writing meaningful tests is a skill that takes learning, some unlearning, and a lot of practice, and with this book, you'll hone that skill. Fire up the editor and get hands-on through practical exercises for effective automated testing and designing maintainable, modular code.

Start by learning when and why to do manual testing vs. automated verification. Focus tests on the important things, like the pre-conditions, the invariants, complex logic, and gnarly edge cases. Then begin to design asynchronous functions using automated tests. Carefully decouple and mock out intricate dependencies such as the DOM, geolocation API, file and database access, and Ajax calls to remote servers.

Step by step, test code that uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and AngularJS. Know when and how to use tools such as Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Mocha, Protractor, and Sinon. Create tests with minimum effort and run them fast without having to spin up web servers or manually edit HTML pages to run in browsers. Then explore end-to-end testing to ensure all parts are wired and working well together.

Don't just imagine creating testable code, write it.

What You Need:

A computer with a text editor and your favorite browser. The book provides instructions to install the necessary automated testing-related tools.

Genre: Video Training

A guide to work with MySQL and it's syntax, CRUD, data types, transactions, sub selects, views, and store routines. MySQL is by far the most popular database management system for small- to medium-sized web projects. Only the proprietary Oracle database and the small embeddable SQLite are more widely deployed. MySQL is named after the eldest daughter of Ulf Michael Widenius, the main author of the original version of MySQL whose daughter's name is My.

MySQL routines the Structured Query Language also known as SQL to define, update and query the database. SQL is used on fundamentally all major relational database systems, on many platforms and in many applications. I will cover the necessary skills to use and program a database using MySQL. It is the nature of database management systems that there is marvellous divergence between how SQL is implemented in each system. Most of this course is keen on showing you how SQL is implemented by MySQL and how it can be used effectively in your database applications.

In this course, I will provide clear, concise tutorials that guide you through creating and maintaining a MySQL database of your own. We will start with the basic syntax of SQL as it's implemented by MySQL. I will explain how to use the select statement, and how to create, update, and delete data from your tables. I'll show you specifically where the MySQL version of SQL differs from the standard, and how to get the most out of MySQL specific dialect.

I also will explore the

basic syntax,
using SQL statements to
Create
Insert
Update
And delete data from your tables
I will also cover creating a new database from scratch
Data types
Transactions
Subselects
Views
And stored routines
Plus, learn about the multi-platform PHP PDO interface that will help you connect your database to web applications.

I will cover creating and deleting databases, data types, transactions, sub selects, views, and stored routines. And finally, I will show you a full working CRUD application. CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. MySQL is one of the most widely deployed database management systems in the world. Understanding MySQL will serve you well in your database applications.

R is a language and programming environment for statistical analysis and graphic. It is a project of free software , a result of the implementation GNU classic scientific language S-plus. R and S-plus are probably the two languages most commonly used in research by community statistics, is also very popular in the field of the biomedical research , the bioinformatics and the financial mathematics . This contributes to the possibility of charging different libraries or packages for specific purposes of calculation or graph. is available for the operating systems Windows , Macintosh , UNIX and GNU/Linux .
R provides a wide range of statistical tools (models linear and non-linear , statistical tests , analysis of time series , algorithms of classification and clustering , etc.) and graphic. Like S-Plus, it's a programming language, allowing users to extend it by defining your own functions. In fact, most of the functions of R are written in the same R, although algorithms for computationally demanding is possible to develop libraries in C , C++ or Fortran that are loaded dynamically. Advanced users can also manipulate R objects directly from code developed in C. R also can spread through packages developed by its community of users.
R is part of a collaborative and open project. Your users can publish packages that extend its basic configuration. Given the huge number of new packages, these have been organized in views (or themes) , which allow you to group them according to their nature and function. For example, there are groups of related packages with Bayesian statistics , Econometrics , time series , etc.
R, like S plus, can be considered an object oriented programming language. In addition, R can be integrated with different databases and there are libraries that facilitate its use from programming languages interpreted as Perl and Python . R also has its own format for the documentation based on LaTeX .
Another feature of R is its graphical capability, which allows you to generate high-quality graphics.
R can also be used as a tool of numerical calculation , field in which it can be as effective as other specific tools such as GNU Octave and its commercial equivalent, MATLAB.

Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. This program will teach you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

Project
P0: Titanic Survival Exploration

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

Project
P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

Project
P2: Build a Student Intervention System

A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, your task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that you find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. You will need to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.

Project
P3: Creating Customer Segments

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

Project
P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive

In the not-so-distant future, taxicab companies across the United States no longer employ human drivers to operate their fleet of vehicles. Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents — known as smartcabs — to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on smartcabs to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although smartcabs have become the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.

Project
P5: Capstone Project

In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.

You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct conclusions about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem. 

Project
Resume Review

In this project, you will update your resume according to the conventions that recruiters expect and get tips on how to best represent yourself to pass the "6 second screen". You will also make sure that your resume is appropriately targeted for the job you’re applying for. We recommend all students update their resumes to show off their newly acquired skills regardless of whether you are looking for a new job soon.

Project
Technical Interview Practice

For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?

Why Take This Nanodegree Program?

This program will equip you with key skills that will prepare you to fill roles with companies seeking machine learning experts (or to introduce machine learning techniques to their organizations). Machine learning is literally everywhere, and is often at work even when we don’t realize it.

46 <--> Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks in Python

Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks in Python: LSTM, GRU, and more RNN machine learning architectures in Python and Theano (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | 8 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01K31SQQA | 86 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.44 MB

Like Markov models, Recurrent Neural Networks are all about learning sequences - but whereas Markov Models are limited by the Markov assumption, Recurrent Neural Networks are not - and as a result, they are more expressive, and more powerful than anything we’ve seen on tasks that we haven’t made progress on in decades. 

In the first section of the course we are going to add the concept of time to our neural networks. 

I’ll introduce you to the Simple Recurrent Unit, also known as the Elman unit. 

We are going to revisit the XOR problem, but we’re going to extend it so that it becomes the parity problem - you’ll see that regular feedforward neural networks will have trouble solving this problem but recurrent networks will work because the key is to treat the input as a sequence.

In the next section of the book, we are going to revisit one of the most popular applications of recurrent neural networks - language modeling. 

One popular application of neural networks for language is word vectors or word embeddings. The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec, but I’ll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors. 

In the section after, we’ll look at the very popular LSTM, or long short-term memory unit, and the more modern and efficient GRU, or gated recurrent unit, which has been proven to yield comparable performance. 

We’ll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result. 

All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Theano. I am always available to answer your questions and help you along your data science journey. 

See you in class!

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn professional game development techniques using the Unity 3D platform.

From explosion blasts to motorcycle crashes, games are riddled with physical reactions. Find out how to trigger these events, and how to take your character movement beyond walk cycles.

For some visuals, take this random youtube video of GTA V motorcycle crashes. How do you know when a character is supposed to react? And if you do know, how can you make it look realistic? You can’t resort to some crouching position set up by an animator, there’s a de facto infinite amounts of ways on how a character can get impacted. Or this MK clip. Uppercutted someone and then set up a combo to slam them back to the ground? Can’t do it without dynamics.

If you want to create games that people really love, you need to know game dynamics. In this course you will learn game dynamics from a professional game developer using the free and popular Unity 3D game development platform.

What Is Game Dynamics?

Game Dynamics (sometimes confused with Game Mechanics) has been difficult for the game development world to describe using words. The best definition consists of three parts in order to understand the whole idea of Game Dynamics:

Mechanics are the formal rules of the game. The agents, objects, elements and their relationships in the game. They define the game as a rule-based system, specifying what there is, how everything behaves, and how the player can interact with the gameworld.
Dynamics are the emergent behavior that arises from gameplay, when the Mechanics are put into use.
Aesthetics are the emotional response from the players to the gameplay.
More About the Course

This course aims to give you a solid overview of how Game Dynamics can be integrated into any game you're creating, as well as how to use Unity 3D tools such as the Mecanim Animation System to achieve a dynamic game environment.

Big Data, MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark with Python: Master Big Data Analytics and Data Wrangling with MapReduce Fundamentals using Hadoop, Spark, and Python by LazyProgrammer
English | 15 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01KH9YWSY | 58 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.07 MB

What’s the big deal with big data? It was recently reported in the Wall Street Journal that the government is collecting so much data on its citizens that they can’t even use it effectively. 

A few “unicorns” have popped up in the past decade or so, promising to help solve the big data problems that billion dollar corporations and the people running your country can’t. 

It goes without saying that programming with frameworks that can do big data processing is a highly-coveted skill. 

Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, which have garnered increased attention (and fear-mongering) in recent years, mainly due to the rise of deep learning, are completely dependent on data to learn. 

The more data the algorithm learns from, the smarter it can become. The problem is, the amount of data we collect has outpaced gains in CPU performance. Therefore, scalable methods for processing data are needed. 

In the early 2000s, Google invented MapReduce, a framework to systematically and methodically process big data in a scalable way by distributing the work across multiple machines. 

Later, the technology was adopted into an open-source framework called Hadoop, and then Spark emerged as a new big data framework which addressed some problems with MapReduce. 

In this book we will cover all 3 - the fundamental MapReduce paradigm, how to program with Hadoop, and how to program with Spark. 

Advance your Career

If Spark is a better version of MapReduce, why are we even talking about it? 

Good question! 

Corporations, being slow-moving entities, are often still using Hadoop due to historical reasons. Just search for “big data” and “Hadoop” on LinkedIn and you will see that there are a large number of high-salary openings for developers who know how to use Hadoop. 

In addition to giving you deeper insight into how big data processing works, learning about the fundamentals of MapReduce and Hadoop first will help you really appreciate how much easier Spark is to work with. 

Any startup or technical engineering team will appreciate a solid background with all of these technologies. Many will require you to know all of them, so that you can help maintain and patch their existing systems, and build newer and more efficient systems that improve the performance and robustness of the old systems.

How Machines Learn: An Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning by Helen Edwards
English | 30 Aug. 2016 | ASIN: B01LBQLR6M | 63 Pages | PDF (True) | 15.03 MB

Artificial intelligence is changing our lives in ways we need to understand. Algorithms govern how we find information, how we learn, how we move, how we buy, what we buy, how we stay healthy, how we meet, whom we meet, how we are treated and what we are treated with. Marketing, analytics, diagnostics, manufacturing, driving, searching, speaking, seeing, hearing are all being disrupted and reshaped by machines that learn. Algorithms that can operate at the speed and scale that data is now generated are now making, what once was impossible, a practical reality. 

The goal of this book is to get you up to speed on what drives the artificial intelligence you encounter today so you can understand what makes this field of computer science different from the software engineering of the past. It is aimed at executives who would like to use machine learning in their business and want to understand the underlying mechanics, and for anyone else who wants to understand more about the architectures driving artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Design and architecture of any software/solution provides the base and makes it flexible, extensible for future requirements. A good designed software/solution makes it easy to understand and maintain. Design patterns are known as best practices to design software for problems which are repeated in nature.

This course "Design Patterns Through C++" gives you understanding of all 23 patterns described in Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

Each pattern is explained in a simple way with intent, problem, solution and structure. Also the information of participants, collaboration, consequences and implementation are explained for each one. The pattern structure or example implementation of C++ source are explained to understand how it will be implemented in Object Oriented language C++.

The course also provides C++ source code of each pattern to understand it in better way. This helps in applying the variation on implementation to see how it can resolve some other implementation bottleneck. There are quizzes after Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns to check your understanding.

This course will help to understand the best practices for design and apply them to do the better design of software/solution in C++.

It will be good to have the Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides as a reference book for this course.

Introduction to WinAPI by Ivan Shumskiy
English | 20 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01KRSYRXU | 362 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.52 MB

Win32 API (hereinafter WinAPI) - a set of functions (API - application programming interfaces), running under Windows environment. These functions are contained in windows.h library. 
Windows API is designed to be used with C language to write the applications under MS Windows operating system environment. Windows API is the closest way to interact with operating system from the application level. The lower level access is required only for device drivers in the current versions 
of Windows and is available through the Windows Driver Model. 
Windows API is a set of functions, data structures and numerical constants, that follow C language conventions. All programming languages that can call to such functions and to operate these types of data in the programs executed under Windows, can use this API. In particular, the languages C ++, 
Pascal, Visual Basic, and many others. 
Using WinAPI functions you can easily create different window procedures, dialog boxes, software and even games. This library, so far, is the base for the development of Windows Forms programming, 
MFC, because these interfaces are add-ons for that library. If you master it, you will easily create forms and understand how this happens.

53 <--> Verified Functional Programming in Agda
http://nitroflare.com/view/88DCEEF260D0F25/1970001240.pdf


Aaron Stump, "Verified Functional Programming in Agda" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 1970001240 | 283 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Agda is an advanced programming language based on Type Theory. Agda's type system is expressive enough to support full functional verification of programs, in two styles. In external verification, we write pure functional programs and then write proofs of properties about them. The proofs are separate external artifacts, typically using structural induction. In internal verification, we specify properties of programs through rich types for the programs themselves. This often necessitates including proofs inside code, to show the type checker that the specified properties hold. The power to prove properties of programs in these two styles is a profound addition to the practice of programming, giving programmers the power to guarantee the absence of bugs, and thus improve the quality of software more than previously possible. Verified Functional Programming in Agda is the first book to provide a systematic exposition of external and internal verification in Agda, suitable for undergraduate students of Computer Science. No familiarity with functional programming or computer-checked proofs is presupposed. The book begins with an introduction to functional programming through familiar examples like booleans, natural numbers, and lists, and techniques for external verification. Internal verification is considered through the examples of vectors, binary search trees, and Braun trees. More advanced material on type-level computation, explicit reasoning about termination, and normalization by evaluation is also included. The book also includes a medium-sized case study on Huffman encoding and decoding. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter.

36 <--> Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach (repost) --> library

Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach by Guojun Gan
English | 13 May 2011 | ISBN: 1439862230 | 520 Pages | PDF | 4 MB

Data clustering is a highly interdisciplinary field, the goal of which is to divide a set of objects into homogeneous groups such that objects in the same group are similar and objects in different groups are quite distinct. Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms.

Using object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++ exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered.

This book is divided into three parts–

Data Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns
A C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes
Data Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithms
A key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm. Complete listings of classes, examples, unit test cases, and GNU configuration files are included in the appendices of this book as well as in the CD-ROM of the book. The only requirements to compile the code are a modern C++ compiler and the Boost C++ libraries.

Learn how to set, test or reverse bits - interview favorites, made easy with a visual approach that you will love

Programming interviews are like standard plays in professional sport - and bit manipulation questions are very common in certain types of interviews!

This course has been drawn by a team that has conducted hundreds of technical interviews at Google and Flipkart

Bit manipulation problems are an interview favorite, and they also pop up in some real-word programming cases, particularly low-level or very computationally intensive tasks.

What's covered:

The bitwise AND, OR, NOT operators: Visually understand exactly how the bitwise AND, OR and NOT operators work
Bitwise Shifting - Overflow and Fill: The bitwise shift operators can be quite tricky - we cover these in some detail
Bit Manipulation - get and set a specific bit

Byte-Sized-Chunks: C++ Templates and the STL
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 2 Hours | 768 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Compile-time polymorphism via templates, C++ casts, containers, algorithms and iterators - all will make sense now!

Like a gruff uncle, C++ seems intimidating, when its just being helpful. These examples will help you understand that.

Let's parse that.

C++ seems intimidating because all too often, what you see is not what you get.
Usually, that's because C++ is trying to help you, but you don't realise that. C++ is incredibly deep, and it sometimes struggles to get you - the programmer - to understand what it's saying
These examples will help. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific C++ use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.
What's Included:

Templates are a classic generic programming technique that were revolutionary when first added to C++. Understand template functions and classes, as well as template specializations.
STL - the Standard Template Library - is incredibly powerful. Get a good sense of collections, iterators and algorithms - the major components of the STL
C++ casts are quite different than C-casts. Understand const_cast, static_cast and dynamic_cast, as well as Real Time Type Identification (RTTI), and the manner in which explicit conversions can be performed using static_cast

Assignment, Pre- and Post-Increment, And Streaming Operators Will Make So Much Sense Now!

Operator overloading is a particularly complicated topic - C++ is virtually alone in the ubiquity of overloaded operators. Make sure this doesn't trip you up.

What is operator overloading? Understand internal operators, defined as member functions of a class vs external operators defined as global functions. External operators are commonly friend functions of the class on which they operate.
Internal or External? When would you choose to have an internal operator implementation vs an external operator implementation? Sometimes you don't have a choice!

4 <--> Deep Learning in Python

Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | March 11, 2016 | ASIN: B01CVJ19E8 | 38 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.19 MB

Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. 

Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! 

While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. 

All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU. 

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces. 

On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful. 

Data Science and Machine Learning

Data science is a trending field in tech and a big part of it is “machine learning”. These are programs that can learn automatically learn what their output should be, instead of trying to manually program it yourself. 

Many startups who are starting to see growth now want to quantify their data and perform analyses that optimize sales, customers, and profit. 

In recent news, Google’s deep learning machine has produced “dream images”. Their machines are so much like the brain, they can produce dreams! In this course, we’re going to cover a technology made by Google just for deep learning, called TensorFlow. We are also going to look at a library that has been around for much longer called Theano. I am going to show you how to build neural networks from scratch using both of these very awesome tools. 

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to take the things you’ve learned, and create very powerful machine learning models to do things like sports betting, stock market prediction, and revenue optimization at your company.

10 <--> Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages (Repost)


Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages By Matthew J. Sottile
2009 | 344 Pages | ISBN: 1420072137 | PDF | 6 MB


Exploring how concurrent programming can be assisted by language-level techniques, Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages presents high-level language techniques for dealing with concurrency in a general context. It provides an understanding of programming languages that offer concurrency features as part of the language definition. The book supplies a conceptual framework for different aspects of parallel algorithm design and implementation. It first addresses the limitations of traditional programming techniques and models when dealing with concurrency. The book then explores the current state of the art in concurrent programming and describes high-level language constructs for concurrency. It also discusses the historical evolution of hardware, corresponding high-level techniques that were developed, and the connection to modern systems, such as multicore and manycore processors. The remainder of the text focuses on common high-level programming techniques and their application to a range of algorithms. The authors offer case studies on genetic algorithms, fractal generation, cellular automata, game logic for solving Sudoku puzzles, pipelined algorithms, and more. Illustrating the effect of concurrency on programs written in familiar languages, this text focuses on novel language abstractions that truly bring concurrency into the language and aid analysis and compilation tools in generating efficient, correct programs. It also explains the complexity involved in taking advantage of concurrency with regard to program correctness and performance.

17 <--> Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining
http://nitroflare.com/view/C12CB05C80A55A6/3319257404.pdf


Henning Wachsmuth, "Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining" 
2015 | ISBN-10: 3319257404 | 302 pages | PDF | 19 MB

This monograph proposes a comprehensive and fully automatic approach to designing text analysis pipelines for arbitrary information needs that are optimal in terms of run-time efficiency and that robustly mine relevant information from text of any kind. Based on state-of-the-art techniques from machine learning and other areas of artificial intelligence, novel pipeline construction and execution algorithms are developed and implemented in prototypical software. Formal analyses of the algorithms and extensive empirical experiments underline that the proposed approach represents an essential step towards the ad-hoc use of text mining in web search and big data analytics.
Both web search and big data analytics aim to fulfill peoples’ needs for information in an adhoc manner. The information sought for is often hidden in large amounts of natural language text. Instead of simply returning links to potentially relevant texts, leading search and analytics engines have started to directly mine relevant information from the texts. To this end, they execute text analysis pipelines that may consist of several complex information-extraction and text-classification stages. Due to practical requirements of efficiency and robustness, however, the use of text mining has so far been limited to anticipated information needs that can be fulfilled with rather simple, manually constructed pipelines.

18 <--> Words and Graphs

Sergey Kitaev and Vadim Lozin, "Words and Graphs" 
English | ISBN: 3319258575 | 2016 | 284 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This is the first comprehensive introduction to the theory of word-representable graphs, a generalization of several classical classes of graphs, and a new topic in discrete mathematics. After extensive introductory chapters that explain the context and consolidate the state of the art in this field, including a chapter on hereditary classes of graphs, the authors suggest a variety of problems and directions for further research, and they discuss interrelations of words and graphs in the literature by means other than word-representability. The book is self-contained, and is suitable for both reference and learning, with many chapters containing exercises and solutions to seleced problems. It will be valuable for researchers and graduate and advanced undergraduate students in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular those engaged with graph theory and combinatorics, and also for specialists in algebra.

Prior Processes and Their Applications: Nonparametric Bayesian Estimation, Second Edition
Springer | Statistics | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319327887 | 327 pages | pdf | 3.14 mb

Authors: Phadia, Eswar G.
Presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes
Provides valuable resource for nonparametric Bayesian analysis of big data
Includes a section on machine learning
Shows practical examples

This book presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes that have been developed over the past four decades for dealing with Bayesian approach to solving selected nonparametric inference problems. This revised edition has been substantially expanded to reflect the current interest in this area. After an overview of different prior processes, it examines the now pre-eminent Dirichlet process and its variants including hierarchical processes, then addresses new processes such as dependent Dirichlet, local Dirichlet, time-varying and spatial processes, all of which exploit the countable mixture representation of the Dirichlet process. It subsequently discusses various neutral to right type processes, including gamma and extended gamma, beta and beta-Stacy processes, and then describes the Chinese Restaurant, Indian Buffet and infinite gamma-Poisson processes, which prove to be very useful in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval and featural modeling. Tailfree and Polya tree and their extensions form a separate chapter, while the last two chapters present the Bayesian solutions to certain estimation problems pertaining to the distribution function and its functional based on complete data as well as right censored data. Because of the conjugacy property of some of these processes, most solutions are presented in closed form.
However, the current interest in modeling and treating large-scale and complex data also poses a problem – the posterior distribution, which is essential to Bayesian analysis, is invariably not in a closed form, making it necessary to resort to simulation. Accordingly, the book also introduces several computational procedures, such as the Gibbs sampler, Blocked Gibbs sampler and slice sampling, highlighting essential steps of algorithms while discussing specific models. In addition, it features crucial steps of proofs and derivations, explains the relationships between different processes and provides further clarifications to promote a deeper understanding. Lastly, it includes a comprehensive list of references, equipping readers to explore further on their own.

Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R By Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson
2009 | 449 Pages | ISBN: 1420068725 | PDF | 8 MB


Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.

164 <--> Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Springer | Theoretical Computer Science | Aug 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403397 | 464 pages | pdf | 8.5 mb

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Clojure Reactive Programming By Leonardo Borges
2015 | 232 Pages | ISBN: 1783986662 | EPUB, MOBI, PDF | 15 MB


Reactive Programming (RP) is central to many concurrent systems. It endeavors to make the process of developing highly-concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications simpler and less error-prone. RP comes in many flavors and we will look at some of them in this book. Clojure Reactive Programming is a practical guide aimed at exploring RP. It starts by describing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and its formulations, as well as how it inspired Compositional Event Systems (CES). It also presents several examples of Reactive applications implemented in different frameworks, allowing you to develop an understanding of the subject as well as learn how to develop your ability to work with time-varying values. By the end of the book, you will be equipped to solve real-world problems and have a clear understanding of when and how you should use different the approaches that are shown in the book.

C# Deconstructed: Discover How C# Works on the .Net Framework By Mohammad Rahman
2014 | 172 Pages | ISBN: 1430266708 | PDF | 5 MB


The basic operational design of a computer system is called its architecture. John von Neumann, a pioneer in computer design, is credited with the architecture of most computers in use today. A typical von Neumann system has three major components: the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor; physical memory; and input/output (I/O). In von Neumann architecture (VNA) machines, such as the 80x86 family, the CPU is where all the computations of any applications take place. An application is simply a combination of machine instructions and data. To be executed by the CPU, an application needs to reside in physical memory. Typically, the application program is written using a mechanism called programming language. To understand how any given programming language works, it is important to know how it interacts with the operating system (OS), software that manages the underlying hardware and that provides services to the application, as well as how the CPU executes applications. In this chapter, you will learn the basic architecture of the CPU (microcode, instruction set) and how it executes instructions, fetching them from memory. You will then learn how memory works, how the OS manages the CPU and memory, and how the OS offers a layer of abstraction to a programming language. Finally, the sections on language evaluation will give you a high-level overview of how C# and common language runtime (CLR) evolved and the reason they are needed.

305 <--> Natural Language Processing in Python

LazyProgrammer, "Natural Language Processing in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning for spam detection, sentiment analysis, latent semantic analysis, and article spinning" 
2016 | ASIN: B01FTJLKYQ | 54 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Recently, Microsoft’s Twitter bot “Tay” was released into the wild, and quickly began making racist and hateful statements after learning from other Twitter users. The technology behind this? Natural language processing. 

NLP is the use of machine learning algorithms for problems that involve text. 

Do you ever wonder why you get much less spam in your inbox these days compared to 10 years ago? What kinds of algorithms are people using to do spam detection? How can they take words in an email and know how to compute whether or not it’s spam? In this book you are going to build your very own spam detector. 

Did you know people have already used Twitter to determine the current sentiment about a particular company to decide whether or not they should buy or sell stocks? Having a machine that can decide how people feel about something is immensely useful and immediately applicable to revenue optimization. In this course you are going to build your own sentiment analyzer. 

Are you an Internet marketer or are you interested in SEO? Have you ever wanted to know how you can automatically generate content? In this course we are going to take a first crack at building your own article spinner. You’ll learn to write programs that can take an article as input and spit out a similar article with different words as output. This can save you tons of time and thousands of dollars if you’re paying someone to write content for you. 

Natural Language Processing, or as it is often abbreviated, NLP - is the use of programming and math to do language-based tasks. 

If you have Windows or iOS then you have NLP right in front of you! Cortana and Siri are applications that take what you say and turn it into something meaningful that can be done programmatically. 

The key point: NLP is highly practical. NLP is everywhere. 

This book is split up into multiple sections based on the various practical tasks that you can do with NLP: 

Before we do any real programming exercises we’ll look at common NLP tasks (some of these we will actually code ourselves, the others are mentioned so you at least know they exist). We will then look at common data pre-processing techniques used for text. As you’ll see, this preprocessing is what will actually take up a majority of your time when you’re doing NLP. 

The first programming exercise we’ll do is look at how to build a spam detector. Your email inbox uses this, so it’s clearly very useful and it’s been the subject of study for a long time. 

Next we’ll look at “sentiment analysis” and you’ll build your own “sentiment analyzer”. This is how a computer can judge how positive or negative some text is based on the words and phrases that are used. This is also immediately practical - some people have analyzed Twitter feeds to predict whether a stock would go up or down. 

After that we’ll look at the NLTK library. This is a very popular library that solves a lot of fundamental problems in NLP - and you can use it in conjunction with other libraries in your data analysis pipeline. 

Next we’ll look at “latent semantic analysis”. This is basically doing dimensionality reduction on text - and it helps us solve the problem of 2 words having the same meaning. It also helps us interpret our data and save on computation time. 

Lastly, we’ll talk about one of the most popular applications of NLP - article spinning. This is very practical for internet marketers and entrepreneurs. As you know, your search rankings in Google and other search engines are affected negatively when you have duplicate content - so it would be great if you could alter an article you wrote just enough, so that you could put it in 2 different places on the web, without being penalized by Google.

306 <--> Convolutional Neural Networks in Python

LazyProgrammer, "Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow" 
2016 | ASIN: B01FQDREOK | 52 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU. 

This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST. 

In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge! 

Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection. 

After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset. 

307 <--> Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python

LazyProgrammer, "Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Cluster Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Principal Components Analysis" 
2016 | ASIN: B01G1HH5T4 | 56 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

In a real-world environment, you can imagine that a robot or an artificial intelligence won’t always have access to the optimal answer, or maybe there isn’t an optimal correct answer. You’d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns. 

Think about the large amounts of data being collected today, by the likes of the NSA, Google, and other organizations. No human could possibly sift through all that data manually. It was reported recently in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal that the National Security Agency collects so much surveillance data, it is no longer effective. 

Could automated pattern discovery solve this problem? 

Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms? 

Kaggle always seems to provide us with a nice CSV, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys. 

If you haven’t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data! 

A lot of the time this involves manual labor. Sometimes, you don’t have access to the correct information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire. 

You still want to have some idea of the structure of the data. 

This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play. 

In this book we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels. We’ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike. 

The 2 methods of clustering we’ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.

Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, we’ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation, where we talk about how to learn the probability distribution of a set of data. 

One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! We’ll prove how this is the case. 

Lastly, we’ll look at the theory behind principal components analysis or PCA. PCA has many useful applications: visualization, dimensionality reduction, denoising, and de-correlation. You will see how it allows us to take a different perspective on latent variables, which first appear when we talk about k-means clustering and GMMs. 

All the algorithms we’ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that

Beginning Haskell: A Project-Based Approach By Alejandro Serrano Mena
2014 | 300 Pages | ISBN: 1430262508 | EPUB + MOBI | 5 MB + 8 MB


Beginning Haskell provides a broad-based introduction to the Haskell language, its libraries and environment, and to the functional programming paradigm that is fast growing in importance in the software industry. The book takes a project-based approach to learning the language that is unified around the building of a web-based storefront. Excellent coverage is given to the Haskell ecosystem and supporting tools. These include the Cabal build tool for managing projects and modules, the QuickCheck tool for software testing, web frameworks such as Yesud and Snap, and the Persistent and Esqueleto database access libraries. Functional programming is gathering momentum, allowing programmers to express themselves in a more concise way, reducing boilerplate and increasing the safety of code. Indeed, mainstream languages such as C# and Java are adopting features from functional programming, and from languages implementing that paradigm. Haskell is an elegant and noise-free pure functional language with a long history, having a huge number of library contributors and an active community. This makes Haskell the best tool for both learning and applying functional programming, and Beginning Haskell the perfect book to show off the language and what it can do. Beginning Haskell is for programmers new to functional programming, who want to learn this new paradigm and how it can improve the quality of their code. Beginning Haskell is also a great choice for functional programmers wanting to get a taste of the Haskell ecosystem and its unique features, or who wish to learn about advanced functional design patterns.

eLearning

The Structured Query Language (or SQL) is how we both define and manipulate data within a traditional Relational Database Management System (or RDBMS). In this course, we are going to learn how to structure SQL statements that do just that. Learn how to create databases, manage access, create tables, insert and update data, create indexes and more. We will demonstrate SQL functions and talk about how they differ from the more traditional SQL statements. All of this will be accomplished at a SQL command line within MySQL, but will apply equally to SQL compliant RDBMS systems in general.

Don't waste hours learning SQL concepts you will never use. Pass most technical interviews or get your money back!

I produced the highest rated SQL training video with over 301,000 views and 2800 likes. If you have any doubts, scroll down and read the comments on my SQL videos! Just ranked in the top group of instructors!

This is an SQL course for job seeking beginners or people who are out of practice, that is designed to guarantee that you pass most SQL tech interviews. This is NOT for Database Administrators. This is for trading support applicants or business folks who might need to use the database for research. If you are trying to learn SQL, then my more advanced courses are awesome for that. This class is a very good video cliff note. Nothing more.

I highly recommend this course for people looking for jobs with other (other than SQL) priorities. For example a job that says "Required: FIX Protocol. Plus: SQL". That is the ideal candidate for this course. I'll tell you exactly what the interviewers will be looking for as far as SQL.

I have years working for companies like investment banks and FinTech venders, so I know what software they have and what you need to know. This course gets you right to the information you need faster than anything else. This frees up your time for other pursuits and getting you to that 6 figure job fast!

Don't take MY word for it, take a look at what some of the 301,000 people who have enjoyed my SQL videos have said:

432 <--> Gnuplot in Action: Understanding Data with Graphs

Philipp K. Janert, "Gnuplot in Action: Understanding Data with Graphs"
English | ISBN: 1933988398 | 2009 | EPUB | 396 pages | 5 MB

Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.

So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot "or have found it tough to get your arms around "read on.

Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot "from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.

One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look "just right" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.

Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots "powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.

Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts, and process engineers.

What's Inside:

Creating graphs with gnuplot
Data transformations and filters
Preparing/polishing graphs for final presentation
Publishing graphs in print or on the Web
Using gnuplot's power features
Gnuplot scripting and programming
Types of graphs and when to use them
Techniques of graphical analysis
How to build, install, and develop for gnuplot

Genre: Video Training

Game developers can learn AI Programming using Finite State Machines in Unity using a real time strategy project example. Complex behavior and decision-making is the goal of any good game AI. There are many methods in approaching this, and one of them is using a decision model called a Finite State Machine (FSM).

A state machine is a very useful model in which the possible conditions of an agent are divided into “states”, which can have “transitions” into and out of each other under defined conditions. This is a concept used in many automatic decision-making implementations, including AI programming in games. In fact, Unity’s animation controller uses the state machine concept to model animation behaviors.

In this tutorial we will implement an FSM-based character AI in the context of a point-and-click real-time-tactical combat game in Unity. 

Enemy characters are expected to be on the lookout for the player characters, attack any within sight, pursue any who try to escape, and try to escape combat themselves when their health is below a certain threshold. Within the tutorial an introduction of the Unity project to be worked on is also included.

Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be familiar with C# programming in Unity and the concept of 3D transforms as it is used in the engine. Although the concept of the state machine itself is also introduced in the tutorial, it would also help if you read up on it first.

Also, it should be noted that the game project in this tutorial is controlled using the Unity Remote 4 app, so make sure you have it installed in your device.

Match 3 games are simple puzzle games where the player is asked to pair three or more identical items on a tiled game board. Popular modern variations include Candy Crush and Bejeweled. Unity is ideally suited to this kind of game design, and it's a great entry point to more complex kinds of game development. This training course is here to help you complete your own match 3 game.

Game developer Kelley Hecker covers topics like creating a grid-based game board, using inheritance to create different types of game pieces, adding obstacles and new levels, detecting matches and clearing pieces, and implementing a user interface complete with a score screen. By the end of the course, members will have a completed game and learned new techniques to apply to their next Unity project.




3 <--> Deep Learning in Python Prerequisites

Deep Learning in Python Prerequisites: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in Python (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | March 19, 2016 | ASIN: B01D7GDRQ2 | 43 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.31 MB

Do you find deep learning difficult? So you want to learn about deep learning and neural networks, but you don’t have a clue what machine learning even is. This book is for you. 

Perhaps you’ve already tried to read some tutorials about deep learning, and were just left scratching your head because you did not understand any of it. This book is for you. 

Believe the hype. Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. 

Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! 

While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the prerequisites of neural networks, so that learning about neural networks in the future will seem like a natural extension of these topics. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. 

All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. 

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will eventually let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network is made up of logistic regression units. 

Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you. 

This book was designed to contain all the prerequisite information you need for my next book, Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow. 

There are many techniques that you should be comfortable with before diving into deep learning. For example, the “backpropagation” algorithm is just gradient descent, which is the same technique that is used to solve logistic regression. 

The error functions and output functions of a neural network are exactly the same as those used in linear regression and logistic regression. The training process is nearly identical. Thus, learning about linear regression and logistic regression before you embark on your deep learning journey will make things much, much simpler for you.
