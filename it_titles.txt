36 <--> Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach (repost) --> library

Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach by Guojun Gan
English | 13 May 2011 | ISBN: 1439862230 | 520 Pages | PDF | 4 MB

Data clustering is a highly interdisciplinary field, the goal of which is to divide a set of objects into homogeneous groups such that objects in the same group are similar and objects in different groups are quite distinct. Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms.

Using object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++ exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered.

This book is divided into three parts–

Data Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns
A C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes
Data Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithms
A key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm. Complete listings of classes, examples, unit test cases, and GNU configuration files are included in the appendices of this book as well as in the CD-ROM of the book. The only requirements to compile the code are a modern C++ compiler and the Boost C++ libraries.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Compile-time polymorphism via templates, C++ casts, containers, algorithms and iterators - all will make sense now!

Like a gruff uncle, C++ seems intimidating, when its just being helpful. These examples will help you understand that.

Let's parse that.

C++ seems intimidating because all too often, what you see is not what you get.
Usually, that's because C++ is trying to help you, but you don't realise that. C++ is incredibly deep, and it sometimes struggles to get you - the programmer - to understand what it's saying
These examples will help. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific C++ use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.
What's Included:

Templates are a classic generic programming technique that were revolutionary when first added to C++. Understand template functions and classes, as well as template specializations.
STL - the Standard Template Library - is incredibly powerful. Get a good sense of collections, iterators and algorithms - the major components of the STL
C++ casts are quite different than C-casts. Understand const_cast, static_cast and dynamic_cast, as well as Real Time Type Identification (RTTI), and the manner in which explicit conversions can be performed using static_cast

Assignment, Pre- and Post-Increment, And Streaming Operators Will Make So Much Sense Now!

Operator overloading is a particularly complicated topic - C++ is virtually alone in the ubiquity of overloaded operators. Make sure this doesn't trip you up.

What is operator overloading? Understand internal operators, defined as member functions of a class vs external operators defined as global functions. External operators are commonly friend functions of the class on which they operate.
Internal or External? When would you choose to have an internal operator implementation vs an external operator implementation? Sometimes you don't have a choice!
The += operator
The assignment operator
Pre- and Post-Increment
Streams and the >> and << operators

A visual way to master basic data structures for strong fundamentals!

This is an animated, visual and spatial way to learn data structures and algorithms

Our brains process different types of information differently - evolutionarily we are wired to absorb information best when it is visual and spatial i.e. when we can close our eyes and see it
More than most other concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms are best learnt visually. These are incredibly easy to learn visually, very hard to understand most other ways
This course has been put together by a team with tons of everyday experience in thinking about these concepts and using them at work at Google, Microsoft and Flipkart
What's Covered:

Big-O notation and complexity
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Heaps

Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | March 11, 2016 | ASIN: B01CVJ19E8 | 38 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.19 MB

Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. 

Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! 

While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. 

All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU. 

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces. 

On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful. 

Data Science and Machine Learning

Data science is a trending field in tech and a big part of it is “machine learning”. These are programs that can learn automatically learn what their output should be, instead of trying to manually program it yourself. 

Many startups who are starting to see growth now want to quantify their data and perform analyses that optimize sales, customers, and profit. 

In recent news, Google’s deep learning machine has produced “dream images”. Their machines are so much like the brain, they can produce dreams! In this course, we’re going to cover a technology made by Google just for deep learning, called TensorFlow. We are also going to look at a library that has been around for much longer called Theano. I am going to show you how to build neural networks from scratch using both of these very awesome tools. 

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to take the things you’ve learned, and create very powerful machine learning models to do things like sports betting, stock market prediction, and revenue optimization at your company. 

Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.

Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages By Matthew J. Sottile
2009 | 344 Pages | ISBN: 1420072137 | PDF | 6 MB


Exploring how concurrent programming can be assisted by language-level techniques, Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages presents high-level language techniques for dealing with concurrency in a general context. It provides an understanding of programming languages that offer concurrency features as part of the language definition. The book supplies a conceptual framework for different aspects of parallel algorithm design and implementation. It first addresses the limitations of traditional programming techniques and models when dealing with concurrency. The book then explores the current state of the art in concurrent programming and describes high-level language constructs for concurrency. It also discusses the historical evolution of hardware, corresponding high-level techniques that were developed, and the connection to modern systems, such as multicore and manycore processors. The remainder of the text focuses on common high-level programming techniques and their application to a range of algorithms. The authors offer case studies on genetic algorithms, fractal generation, cellular automata, game logic for solving Sudoku puzzles, pipelined algorithms, and more. Illustrating the effect of concurrency on programs written in familiar languages, this text focuses on novel language abstractions that truly bring concurrency into the language and aid analysis and compilation tools in generating efficient, correct programs. It also explains the complexity involved in taking advantage of concurrency with regard to program correctness and performance.

17 <--> Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining
http://nitroflare.com/view/C12CB05C80A55A6/3319257404.pdf


Henning Wachsmuth, "Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining" 
2015 | ISBN-10: 3319257404 | 302 pages | PDF | 19 MB

This monograph proposes a comprehensive and fully automatic approach to designing text analysis pipelines for arbitrary information needs that are optimal in terms of run-time efficiency and that robustly mine relevant information from text of any kind. Based on state-of-the-art techniques from machine learning and other areas of artificial intelligence, novel pipeline construction and execution algorithms are developed and implemented in prototypical software. Formal analyses of the algorithms and extensive empirical experiments underline that the proposed approach represents an essential step towards the ad-hoc use of text mining in web search and big data analytics.
Both web search and big data analytics aim to fulfill peoples’ needs for information in an adhoc manner. The information sought for is often hidden in large amounts of natural language text. Instead of simply returning links to potentially relevant texts, leading search and analytics engines have started to directly mine relevant information from the texts. To this end, they execute text analysis pipelines that may consist of several complex information-extraction and text-classification stages. Due to practical requirements of efficiency and robustness, however, the use of text mining has so far been limited to anticipated information needs that can be fulfilled with rather simple, manually constructed pipelines.

Prior Processes and Their Applications: Nonparametric Bayesian Estimation, Second Edition
Springer | Statistics | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319327887 | 327 pages | pdf | 3.14 mb

Authors: Phadia, Eswar G.
Presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes
Provides valuable resource for nonparametric Bayesian analysis of big data
Includes a section on machine learning
Shows practical examples

This book presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes that have been developed over the past four decades for dealing with Bayesian approach to solving selected nonparametric inference problems. This revised edition has been substantially expanded to reflect the current interest in this area. After an overview of different prior processes, it examines the now pre-eminent Dirichlet process and its variants including hierarchical processes, then addresses new processes such as dependent Dirichlet, local Dirichlet, time-varying and spatial processes, all of which exploit the countable mixture representation of the Dirichlet process. It subsequently discusses various neutral to right type processes, including gamma and extended gamma, beta and beta-Stacy processes, and then describes the Chinese Restaurant, Indian Buffet and infinite gamma-Poisson processes, which prove to be very useful in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval and featural modeling. Tailfree and Polya tree and their extensions form a separate chapter, while the last two chapters present the Bayesian solutions to certain estimation problems pertaining to the distribution function and its functional based on complete data as well as right censored data. Because of the conjugacy property of some of these processes, most solutions are presented in closed form.
However, the current interest in modeling and treating large-scale and complex data also poses a problem – the posterior distribution, which is essential to Bayesian analysis, is invariably not in a closed form, making it necessary to resort to simulation. Accordingly, the book also introduces several computational procedures, such as the Gibbs sampler, Blocked Gibbs sampler and slice sampling, highlighting essential steps of algorithms while discussing specific models. In addition, it features crucial steps of proofs and derivations, explains the relationships between different processes and provides further clarifications to promote a deeper understanding. Lastly, it includes a comprehensive list of references, equipping readers to explore further on their own.

Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R By Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson
2009 | 449 Pages | ISBN: 1420068725 | PDF | 8 MB


Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.

More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The C++ Standard Library Quick Reference features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms
• What the standard string class provides and how to use it

http://nitroflare.com/view/1D833D2A0645938/3319285297_Numeric.pdf
https://filejoker.net/43vu20mavl4m


Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system. It is an excellent reference for scientific computations to solve real-world problems using a comprehensive stack of open-source Java libraries included in the DataMelt (DMelt) project and will be appreciated by many data-analysis scientists, engineers and students.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Dr. Fatih Nayebi, "Swift 3 Functional Programming"
English | ISBN: 1785883887 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB/MOBI | 296 pages | 4 MB/3 MB/4 MB

Bring the power of Swift functional programming to iOS, OS X and Web development to build clean, smart and reliable applications

About This Book
Written for Swift 3, this is a comprehensive guide that introduces iOS and OS X developers to the all-new world of functional programming that has so far been alien to them
Learn about first-class functions and how imperative-style patterns can be converted into functional code using some simple techniques
The book will get you familiar with using functional programming alongside existing OOP techniques so you can get the best of both worlds and develop clean, robust code
Who This Book Is For
The book is for iOS, Web, and macOS developers with a basic knowledge of Swift programming that are interested in learning functional programming paradigms

What You Will Learn
First-class, higher-order, and pure functions
Closures and capturing values
Custom operators, recursion, and memoization
Value and reference types in Swift
Enumerations, algebraic data types, patterns, and pattern matching
Generics and associated type protocols
Higher-order functions such as map, flatMap filter, and reduce
Dealing with optionals, fmap, and apply for multiple functional mapping
Functional data structures such as Semigroup, Monoid, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Stack, and Lazy List
Immutability, copy constructors, and lenses
Combining FP paradigms with OOP, FRP, and POP in your day-to-day development activities
Developing a backend application with Swift
Developing an iOS application with FP, OOP, FRP, and POP paradigms

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

2016 | ISBN: 1491959185, 9781491959183 | 74 pages | PDF, EPUB | 12 MB

Linux systems are everywhere today, even in companies once considered "pure Windows." If you’re a sysadmin, network administrator, or developer in a small Windows shop, you may have to jump in and fix a system problem when your site goes down. What if you have no Linux knowledge? This short guide provides tips to help you survive.

Linux systems may appear in your shop as virtual machines or in the cloud, including web servers, databases, mobile device managers, version control, and monitoring systems. When one of them falters, this primer leads you through some diagnostic and recovery tasks so you can quickly get your site back up.
Connect to a Linux system with OpenSSH and PuTTY secure shells
List files and directories, and move around within the file system
Safely inspect the file contents without changing them
Narrow your search by using commands to locate specific files
Use the grep command to search for error messages inside a file
Determine real-time system state to find underlying problems
Examine disk utilization and zero in on space-hogging files
Transfer suspect files from Linux to Windows for later analysis
Use commands to start, stop, restart, or even kill unresponsive services
Know where to find help when troubleshooting isn’t enough

Jim Lehmer has worked with computer systems for over three decades. He’s been involved with software development in various roles, including programmer, systems programmer, software engineer, team lead, and architect.

Springer | Theoretical Computer Science | Aug 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403397 | 464 pages | pdf | 8.5 mb

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Puppet is and has been the de-facto configuration management in Linux and Unix systems. With Puppet 4, it is even bigger and stronger and this course teaches you how to make best use of the Puppet language.

As your server estate grows with more and more virtual systems, so does the difficulty of trying to keep your configurations consistent and reliable. The days of having a few servers to manage are long-gone, and there seems to be an array of different distributions that all require specific tools. Puppet is a mature and respected configuration management tool that is available free of charge as open-source software. In this course, Puppet 4: Language Essentials, you can learn Puppet quickly as the language is written simply with administrators and not developers in mind. First you'll learn how to provide consistent and reliable configuration results, and look at defining configurations as resources. Next, you'll learn to use logic to set the correct service names. Finally you'll be looking at how to restart services after configuration changes. After watching this course, you'll be able to create manifests yourself as well as defining your own configuration needs.

Handbook of Robust Low-Rank and Sparse Matrix Decomposition: Applications in Image and Video Processing shows you how robust subspace learning and tracking by decomposition into low-rank and sparse matrices provide a suitable framework for computer vision applications. Incorporating both existing and new ideas, the book conveniently gives you one-stop access to a number of different decompositions, algorithms, implementations, and benchmarking techniques.

Divided into five parts, the book begins with an overall introduction to robust principal component analysis (PCA) via decomposition into low-rank and sparse matrices. The second part addresses robust matrix factorization/completion problems while the third part focuses on robust online subspace estimation, learning, and tracking. Covering applications in image and video processing, the fourth part discusses image analysis, image denoising, motion saliency detection, video coding, key frame extraction, and hyperspectral video processing. The final part presents resources and applications in background/foreground separation for video surveillance.

With contributions from leading teams around the world, this handbook provides a complete overview of the concepts, theories, algorithms, and applications related to robust low-rank and sparse matrix decompositions. It is designed for researchers, developers, and graduate students in computer vision, image and video processing, real-time architecture, machine learning, and data mining.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Complete course to learn Node.JS with integrated with Elasticsearch, Redis, AngularJS, Yeoman, Grunt, PassportJS, etc…

As you know, Javascript popularity increased tremendously last couple of years. One of the biggest reason is NodeJS. This course aims to teach NodeJS and third party applications from zero to expert level. You will not just learn Hello World project, you will learn What is Blocking, Non-Blocking I/O, Event Loop Mechanism, how is node.js used in real life by interacting other popular technologies and modules like;

Elasticsearch: You will cover Elasticsearch basics, how to use this in order to provide full text search mechanism to your application.

MongoDB: Store your data in to db, and make json queries to this document based database

PassportJS: You will also learn PassportJS to construct authentication system in your application. You will be able to restrict some endpoints by using internal PassportJS properties

ExpressJS: During this course, you will develop complete two web applications. ExpressJS is for developing controllers, communicate this controllers with views, and provide some db interactions by using ORM frameworks like MongooseJS

IronCache: Do you want to make your application faster? You can cache your data to IronCache (Cache as a service) in this lecture also

IronMQ: You will be able to use message queue system by using IronMQ in NodeJS.

SocketIO: Converting your application into realtime application

Well, you will do full stack development in this course. That means, you will be able to develop frontend application with AngularJS by Yeoman, Grunt, Bower. This forntend application will communicate with rest service devloped in this course again.

Yeoman: You will be generating your frontend application with this

Grunt: Your application tasks will be managed and executed by using Grunt

Bower: Tired of using lots of third party js frameworks and deal with conflict, let Bower do that for you

After completing two beautiful application, you will deploy your application into Heroku.

I can give guarantee about becoming expert in NodeJS and related technologies by taking this course. We will do lots of best practices about each technology, and develop examples progressively. Also, at the end of each section, you will be provided Quiz for specific section. Although, this course is a complete reference to NodeJS and related technologies, you can require extra video tutorials for any topic related to NodeJS in order to clearify question marks in your mind. I will publish them in Wishes section.

.NET Development Using the Compiler API by Jason Bock
2016 | ISBN: 1484221109 | English | 140 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

This is the first book to describe the recent significant changes to the Roslyn compiler and demonstrate how .NET developers can use the new Roslyn APIs to create compelling applications.

As an open source compiler, Roslyn now makes its code available for anyone to use. In this book, you’ll get a concise, focused view of this tremendous resource for developers, who can now use any part of the platform implementation to their advantage in analyzing applications, improving code generation, and providing enforceable patterns, all under an OSS model.

You will learn how to analyze your code for defects in a fast, clean manner never available before. You’ll work with solutions and projects to provide automatic refactoring, and you’ll discover how you can generate code dynamically to provide application implementations at runtime

Having the Roslyn compiler API available opens a number of doors for .NET developers that were either simply not there before, or difficult to achieve. However, the API is vast, and this concise book provides a valuable roadmap to this new development environment.

What You Will Learn:
• Understand how to generate, compile, and execute code for a number of scenarios
• How to create diagnostics and refactoring to help developers enforce conventions and design idioms
• Experiment with the compiler code base and see what can be done to influence the inner workings of the compile

Who This Book Is For:
Experienced .NET developers, but detailed compiler knowledge is not necessary.

56 <--> C++ Standard Library Quick Reference
http://nitroflare.com/view/EB87697BE254871/1484218752.epub


C++ Standard Library Quick Reference by Peter Van Weert, Marc Gregoire
2016 | ISBN: 1484218752 | English | 206 pages | EPUB | 2 MB

This quick reference is a condensed reference guide to the essential data structures, algorithms, and functions provided by the C++ Standard Library. More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The C++ Standard Library Quick Reference features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms
• What the standard string class provides and how to use it
• What functionality the library provides for file and stream-based I/O
• What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks
• How to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the C++11 threading libraries

https://filejoker.net/43vu20mavl4m


Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system. It is an excellent reference for scientific computations to solve real-world problems using a comprehensive stack of open-source Java libraries included in the DataMelt (DMelt) project and will be appreciated by many data-analysis scientists, engineers and students.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Dr. Fatih Nayebi, "Swift 3 Functional Programming"
English | ISBN: 1785883887 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB/MOBI | 296 pages | 4 MB/3 MB/4 MB

Bring the power of Swift functional programming to iOS, OS X and Web development to build clean, smart and reliable applications

About This Book
Written for Swift 3, this is a comprehensive guide that introduces iOS and OS X developers to the all-new world of functional programming that has so far been alien to them
Learn about first-class functions and how imperative-style patterns can be converted into functional code using some simple techniques
The book will get you familiar with using functional programming alongside existing OOP techniques so you can get the best of both worlds and develop clean, robust code
Who This Book Is For
The book is for iOS, Web, and macOS developers with a basic knowledge of Swift programming that are interested in learning functional programming paradigms

What You Will Learn
First-class, higher-order, and pure functions
Closures and capturing values
Custom operators, recursion, and memoization
Value and reference types in Swift
Enumerations, algebraic data types, patterns, and pattern matching
Generics and associated type protocols
Higher-order functions such as map, flatMap filter, and reduce
Dealing with optionals, fmap, and apply for multiple functional mapping
Functional data structures such as Semigroup, Monoid, Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Stack, and Lazy List
Immutability, copy constructors, and lenses
Combining FP paradigms with OOP, FRP, and POP in your day-to-day development activities
Developing a backend application with Swift
Developing an iOS application with FP, OOP, FRP, and POP paradigms

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.
