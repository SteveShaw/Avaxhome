R is a language and programming environment for statistical analysis and graphic. It is a project of free software , a result of the implementation GNU classic scientific language S-plus. R and S-plus are probably the two languages most commonly used in research by community statistics, is also very popular in the field of the biomedical research , the bioinformatics and the financial mathematics . This contributes to the possibility of charging different libraries or packages for specific purposes of calculation or graph. is available for the operating systems Windows , Macintosh , UNIX and GNU/Linux .
R provides a wide range of statistical tools (models linear and non-linear , statistical tests , analysis of time series , algorithms of classification and clustering , etc.) and graphic. Like S-Plus, it's a programming language, allowing users to extend it by defining your own functions. In fact, most of the functions of R are written in the same R, although algorithms for computationally demanding is possible to develop libraries in C , C++ or Fortran that are loaded dynamically. Advanced users can also manipulate R objects directly from code developed in C. R also can spread through packages developed by its community of users.
R is part of a collaborative and open project. Your users can publish packages that extend its basic configuration. Given the huge number of new packages, these have been organized in views (or themes) , which allow you to group them according to their nature and function. For example, there are groups of related packages with Bayesian statistics , Econometrics , time series , etc.
R, like S plus, can be considered an object oriented programming language. In addition, R can be integrated with different databases and there are libraries that facilitate its use from programming languages interpreted as Perl and Python . R also has its own format for the documentation based on LaTeX .
Another feature of R is its graphical capability, which allows you to generate high-quality graphics.
R can also be used as a tool of numerical calculation , field in which it can be as effective as other specific tools such as GNU Octave and its commercial equivalent, MATLAB.

It is possible to represent functions, plane curves in parametric, polar, implicit, and explicit coordinates and surfaces. There are several graphics to low level commands that allow you to add certain elements, such as points, lines, texts, legends, titles, axes, boxes and other additional elements to the existing graphics in R. Additionally R performs statistical graphics of all kinds.

Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. This program will teach you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

Project
P0: Titanic Survival Exploration

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

Project
P1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

Project
P2: Build a Student Intervention System

A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, your task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that you find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. You will need to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.

Project
P3: Creating Customer Segments

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

Project
P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive

In the not-so-distant future, taxicab companies across the United States no longer employ human drivers to operate their fleet of vehicles. Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents — known as smartcabs — to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on smartcabs to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although smartcabs have become the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.

Project
P5: Capstone Project

In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.

You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct conclusions about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem. 

Project
Resume Review

In this project, you will update your resume according to the conventions that recruiters expect and get tips on how to best represent yourself to pass the "6 second screen". You will also make sure that your resume is appropriately targeted for the job you’re applying for. We recommend all students update their resumes to show off their newly acquired skills regardless of whether you are looking for a new job soon.

Project
Technical Interview Practice

For this project, you will be given five technical interviewing questions on a variety of topics discussed in the technical interviewing course. You should write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices. A qualified reviewer will look over your answer and give you feedback on anything that might be awesome or lacking—is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?

Why Take This Nanodegree Program?

This program will equip you with key skills that will prepare you to fill roles with companies seeking machine learning experts (or to introduce machine learning techniques to their organizations). Machine learning is literally everywhere, and is often at work even when we don’t realize it. Google Translate, Siri, and Facebook News Feeds are just a few popular examples of machine learning’s omnipresence. The ability to develop machines and systems that automatically improve, puts machine learning at the absolute forefront of virtually any field that relies on data.

Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks in Python: LSTM, GRU, and more RNN machine learning architectures in Python and Theano (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | 8 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01K31SQQA | 86 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.44 MB

Like Markov models, Recurrent Neural Networks are all about learning sequences - but whereas Markov Models are limited by the Markov assumption, Recurrent Neural Networks are not - and as a result, they are more expressive, and more powerful than anything we’ve seen on tasks that we haven’t made progress on in decades. 

In the first section of the course we are going to add the concept of time to our neural networks. 

I’ll introduce you to the Simple Recurrent Unit, also known as the Elman unit. 

We are going to revisit the XOR problem, but we’re going to extend it so that it becomes the parity problem - you’ll see that regular feedforward neural networks will have trouble solving this problem but recurrent networks will work because the key is to treat the input as a sequence.

In the next section of the book, we are going to revisit one of the most popular applications of recurrent neural networks - language modeling. 

One popular application of neural networks for language is word vectors or word embeddings. The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec, but I’ll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors. 

In the section after, we’ll look at the very popular LSTM, or long short-term memory unit, and the more modern and efficient GRU, or gated recurrent unit, which has been proven to yield comparable performance. 

We’ll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result. 

All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib, and Theano. I am always available to answer your questions and help you along your data science journey. 

See you in class!

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn professional game development techniques using the Unity 3D platform.

From explosion blasts to motorcycle crashes, games are riddled with physical reactions. Find out how to trigger these events, and how to take your character movement beyond walk cycles.

For some visuals, take this random youtube video of GTA V motorcycle crashes. How do you know when a character is supposed to react? And if you do know, how can you make it look realistic? You can’t resort to some crouching position set up by an animator, there’s a de facto infinite amounts of ways on how a character can get impacted. Or this MK clip. Uppercutted someone and then set up a combo to slam them back to the ground? Can’t do it without dynamics.

If you want to create games that people really love, you need to know game dynamics. In this course you will learn game dynamics from a professional game developer using the free and popular Unity 3D game development platform.

What Is Game Dynamics?

Game Dynamics (sometimes confused with Game Mechanics) has been difficult for the game development world to describe using words. The best definition consists of three parts in order to understand the whole idea of Game Dynamics:

Mechanics are the formal rules of the game. The agents, objects, elements and their relationships in the game. They define the game as a rule-based system, specifying what there is, how everything behaves, and how the player can interact with the gameworld.
Dynamics are the emergent behavior that arises from gameplay, when the Mechanics are put into use.
Aesthetics are the emotional response from the players to the gameplay.
More About the Course

This course aims to give you a solid overview of how Game Dynamics can be integrated into any game you're creating, as well as how to use Unity 3D tools such as the Mecanim Animation System to achieve a dynamic game environment.

You've probably heard about the benefits that functional programming can bring to your applications, but did you know you can apply many of the same techniques in C#? Did you know that you're probably already using some of them? In this course, you'll learn how to use C# as a functional language by taking advantage of immutability, delegation, generics, and extension methods. You'll even see how these techniques can enhance the usefulness of several of the features introduced in C# 6. Through careful application of these techniques you'll be writing more concise, predictable code with fewer defects in no time.

Big Data, MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark with Python: Master Big Data Analytics and Data Wrangling with MapReduce Fundamentals using Hadoop, Spark, and Python by LazyProgrammer
English | 15 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01KH9YWSY | 58 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.07 MB

What’s the big deal with big data? It was recently reported in the Wall Street Journal that the government is collecting so much data on its citizens that they can’t even use it effectively. 

A few “unicorns” have popped up in the past decade or so, promising to help solve the big data problems that billion dollar corporations and the people running your country can’t. 

It goes without saying that programming with frameworks that can do big data processing is a highly-coveted skill. 

Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, which have garnered increased attention (and fear-mongering) in recent years, mainly due to the rise of deep learning, are completely dependent on data to learn. 

The more data the algorithm learns from, the smarter it can become. The problem is, the amount of data we collect has outpaced gains in CPU performance. Therefore, scalable methods for processing data are needed. 

In the early 2000s, Google invented MapReduce, a framework to systematically and methodically process big data in a scalable way by distributing the work across multiple machines. 

Later, the technology was adopted into an open-source framework called Hadoop, and then Spark emerged as a new big data framework which addressed some problems with MapReduce. 

In this book we will cover all 3 - the fundamental MapReduce paradigm, how to program with Hadoop, and how to program with Spark. 

Advance your Career

If Spark is a better version of MapReduce, why are we even talking about it? 

Good question! 

Corporations, being slow-moving entities, are often still using Hadoop due to historical reasons. Just search for “big data” and “Hadoop” on LinkedIn and you will see that there are a large number of high-salary openings for developers who know how to use Hadoop. 

In addition to giving you deeper insight into how big data processing works, learning about the fundamentals of MapReduce and Hadoop first will help you really appreciate how much easier Spark is to work with. 

Any startup or technical engineering team will appreciate a solid background with all of these technologies. Many will require you to know all of them, so that you can help maintain and patch their existing systems, and build newer and more efficient systems that improve the performance and robustness of the old systems.

Murach's MySQL, 2nd Edition by Joel Murach
English | 2015 | ISBN: 1890774820 | 612 pages | DJVU | 11,5 MB

"If you ever wanted to learn to use MySQL, write SQL queries, create database elements, then this is the book to pick up." (JavaRanch)

"I was amazed at how much information was packed into this book."

"As a developer with almost 10 years of MySQL experience, I still picked up a lot of new detail on things I thought I knew."

"I found this to be a great introductory book to MySQL."

"Has already proven to be helpful in solving several challenges I've encountered on my current MySQL project."

That's a sampling of what developers said about the 1st Edition of Murach's MySQL.

Now, this 2nd Edition has been updated and improved throughout. As a result, it's easier than ever to use for learning MySQL from scratch, for switching to MySQL from another flavor of SQL (like MS SQL Server or Oracle), or for quickly looking up the forgotten details that are so essential as you develop database applications.

Section 1 introduces you to relational databases and SQL, shows you how to use the graphical MySQL Workbench to work with a MySQL database, and teaches you to code SQL queries to retrieve, add, update, and delete data in a MySQL database. Section 2 goes deeper into querying, showing you how to work with summary queries, subqueries, data types, and functions. Section 3 shows you how to design a MySQL database using an EER model, implement the design, and create views. Section 4 shows how to create stored procedures that provide functionality similar to procedural programming languages like PHP, Java, C++, C#, and VB. And Section 5 introduces you to database administration tasks like securing and backing up database data.

Whether you start from the beginning or jump in anywhere, it's a great guide for MySQL users at any level.

How Machines Learn: An Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning by Helen Edwards
English | 30 Aug. 2016 | ASIN: B01LBQLR6M | 63 Pages | PDF (True) | 15.03 MB

Artificial intelligence is changing our lives in ways we need to understand. Algorithms govern how we find information, how we learn, how we move, how we buy, what we buy, how we stay healthy, how we meet, whom we meet, how we are treated and what we are treated with. Marketing, analytics, diagnostics, manufacturing, driving, searching, speaking, seeing, hearing are all being disrupted and reshaped by machines that learn. Algorithms that can operate at the speed and scale that data is now generated are now making, what once was impossible, a practical reality. 

The goal of this book is to get you up to speed on what drives the artificial intelligence you encounter today so you can understand what makes this field of computer science different from the software engineering of the past. It is aimed at executives who would like to use machine learning in their business and want to understand the underlying mechanics, and for anyone else who wants to understand more about the architectures driving artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Learn best practices of software design to provide flexible and reusable software solution

Subtitles are available for Introduction, Case Study and Design Patterns Concepts.

Design and architecture of any software/solution provides the base and makes it flexible, extensible for future requirements. A good designed software/solution makes it easy to understand and maintain. Design patterns are known as best practices to design software for problems which are repeated in nature.

This course "Design Patterns Through C++" gives you understanding of all 23 patterns described in Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

Each pattern is explained in a simple way with intent, problem, solution and structure. Also the information of participants, collaboration, consequences and implementation are explained for each one. The pattern structure or example implementation of C++ source are explained to understand how it will be implemented in Object Oriented language C++.

The course also provides C++ source code of each pattern to understand it in better way. This helps in applying the variation on implementation to see how it can resolve some other implementation bottleneck. There are quizzes after Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns to check your understanding.

This course will help to understand the best practices for design and apply them to do the better design of software/solution in C++.

It will be good to have the Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides as a reference book for this course.

This book may be read by senior students, but it is more likely to be read by programmers and developers, who have done some programming of PC's in Windows or Linux, 
and are now faced with developing devices for the Internet Of Things. 
Basic programming skills are thus assumed, whereas no prior knowledge on TCP/IP and Digital Signal Processing is needed. 
Based on many years of experience as developer, university-teacher and manager, the author's personal view on best practices in the embedded world is offered. 

Part I introduces the main features of Embedded Operating Systems and modern highly integrated CPU's and thus builds the foundation for part II.

Part II - on Internet Protocols and Digital Filters - is the main 'textbook'. It provides a lot of facts, backed up by examples. 
The many network cases are illustrated with the help of WireShark Captures. 
The chapter on digital filters is focused on making the reader understand the basics, without getting lost in formulas. 

Part III describes the authors experience with best practices when working with embedded networking. 
The author's experience as a developer, combined with his overview as manager, results in a pragmatic and higly usable set of guidelines. 

One of the strongest features of this book is the many B/W figures. They make the book inviting and helps the reader remember the knowledge given.

Introduction to WinAPI by Ivan Shumskiy
English | 20 Aug 2016 | ASIN: B01KRSYRXU | 362 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.52 MB

Win32 API (hereinafter WinAPI) - a set of functions (API - application programming interfaces), running under Windows environment. These functions are contained in windows.h library. 
Windows API is designed to be used with C language to write the applications under MS Windows operating system environment. Windows API is the closest way to interact with operating system from the application level. The lower level access is required only for device drivers in the current versions 
of Windows and is available through the Windows Driver Model. 
Windows API is a set of functions, data structures and numerical constants, that follow C language conventions. All programming languages that can call to such functions and to operate these types of data in the programs executed under Windows, can use this API. In particular, the languages C ++, 
Pascal, Visual Basic, and many others. 
Using WinAPI functions you can easily create different window procedures, dialog boxes, software and even games. This library, so far, is the base for the development of Windows Forms programming, 
MFC, because these interfaces are add-ons for that library. If you master it, you will easily create forms and understand how this happens.

Leonard Bolc, "The Design of Interpreters, Compilers, and Editors for Augmented Transition Networks" 
1983 | pages: 224 | ISBN: 3642821243 | DJVU | 1,4 mb

Augmented Transition Network Grammars are at present the most widely used method for analyzing natural languages. Despite the increasing po­ pularity of this method, however, no extensive papers on ATN-Grammars have been presented which would be accessible to a larger number of per­ sons engaged in the problem from both the theoretical and practical points of view. Augmented Transition Networks (ATN) are derived from state automata. Like a finite state automaton, an ATN consists of a collection of la­ beled states and arcs, a distinguished start state and a set of distin­ guished final states. States are connected with each other by arcs crea­ ting a directed graph or net. The label on an arc indicates a terminal symbol (word) or the type of words which must occur in an input stream to allow the transition to the next state. It is said that a sequence of words (or sentence) is accepted by such a net if there exists a se­ quence of arcs (usually called a path), connecting the start state with a final state, which can be followed to the sentence. The finite state automaton is then enriched by several facilities which increase its computational power. The most important of them permits some arcs to be labeled by nonterminal rather than terminal symbols. This means that the transition through such an arc is actually the re­ cursive application of the net beginning with a pointed state.

This course covers the fundamentals of data visualization that every developer needs to know regardless of architecture, platform, tools, or language. At some point in your software development career, you may be called upon to produce a graph or a chart. Delivering on even a simple request can be remarkably complex. How much data is there and where does it live? What kind of chart should you use? Should the chart be rendered on a server or on the client? What kind of clients should you support, and what are the consequences of that choice? This course introduces every aspect of visualization, from story, to numbers, to architecture, to code.

A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up.

It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application.

Managed code is great, but sometimes .NET code must call native code, such as Windows API DLLs or COM components. The course explores most options for interop, from P/Invoke, to COM and even C++/CLI. Best practices are spread throughout the course. A deeper understanding of COM mechanisms provides a better experience and the ability to solve issues should they arise. This course should be helpful for any .NET developer that must introp with native code (and vice versa).

http://nitroflare.com/view/88DCEEF260D0F25/1970001240.pdf


Aaron Stump, "Verified Functional Programming in Agda" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 1970001240 | 283 pages | PDF | 1 MB

Agda is an advanced programming language based on Type Theory. Agda's type system is expressive enough to support full functional verification of programs, in two styles. In external verification, we write pure functional programs and then write proofs of properties about them. The proofs are separate external artifacts, typically using structural induction. In internal verification, we specify properties of programs through rich types for the programs themselves. This often necessitates including proofs inside code, to show the type checker that the specified properties hold. The power to prove properties of programs in these two styles is a profound addition to the practice of programming, giving programmers the power to guarantee the absence of bugs, and thus improve the quality of software more than previously possible. Verified Functional Programming in Agda is the first book to provide a systematic exposition of external and internal verification in Agda, suitable for undergraduate students of Computer Science. No familiarity with functional programming or computer-checked proofs is presupposed. The book begins with an introduction to functional programming through familiar examples like booleans, natural numbers, and lists, and techniques for external verification. Internal verification is considered through the examples of vectors, binary search trees, and Braun trees. More advanced material on type-level computation, explicit reasoning about termination, and normalization by evaluation is also included. The book also includes a medium-sized case study on Huffman encoding and decoding. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter.

TensorFlow For Machine Intelligence: A hands-on introduction to learning algorithms by Sam Abrahams
English | 23 July 2016 | ASIN: B01IZ43JV4 | 322 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 26.87 MB

This book is a hands-on introduction to learning algorithms. It is for people who may know a little machine learning (or not) and who may have heard about TensorFlow, but found the documentation too daunting to approach. The learning curve is gentle and you always have some code to illustrate the math step-by-step. 

TensorFlow, a popular library for machine learning, embraces the innovation and community-engagement of open source, but has the support, guidance, and stability of a large corporation. Because of its multitude of strengths, TensorFlow is appropriate for individuals and businesses ranging from startups to companies as large as, well, Google. TensorFlow is currently being used for natural language processing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and predictive analytics. 

TensorFlow, open sourced to the public by Google in November 2015, was made to be flexible, efficient, extensible, and portable. Computers of any shape and size can run it, from smartphones all the way up to huge computing clusters. This book starts with the absolute basics of TensorFlow. We found that most tutorials on TensorFlow start by attempting to teach both machine learning concepts and TensorFlow terminology at the same time. Here we first make sure you've had the opportunity to become comfortable with TensorFlow's mechanics and core API before covering machine learning concepts.

36 <--> Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach (repost) --> library

Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach by Guojun Gan
English | 13 May 2011 | ISBN: 1439862230 | 520 Pages | PDF | 4 MB

Data clustering is a highly interdisciplinary field, the goal of which is to divide a set of objects into homogeneous groups such that objects in the same group are similar and objects in different groups are quite distinct. Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms.

Using object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++ exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered.

This book is divided into three parts–

Data Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns
A C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes
Data Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithms
A key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm. Complete listings of classes, examples, unit test cases, and GNU configuration files are included in the appendices of this book as well as in the CD-ROM of the book. The only requirements to compile the code are a modern C++ compiler and the Boost C++ libraries.

Genre: eLearning | Language: English

Compile-time polymorphism via templates, C++ casts, containers, algorithms and iterators - all will make sense now!

Like a gruff uncle, C++ seems intimidating, when its just being helpful. These examples will help you understand that.

Let's parse that.

C++ seems intimidating because all too often, what you see is not what you get.
Usually, that's because C++ is trying to help you, but you don't realise that. C++ is incredibly deep, and it sometimes struggles to get you - the programmer - to understand what it's saying
These examples will help. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific C++ use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.
What's Included:

Templates are a classic generic programming technique that were revolutionary when first added to C++. Understand template functions and classes, as well as template specializations.
STL - the Standard Template Library - is incredibly powerful. Get a good sense of collections, iterators and algorithms - the major components of the STL
C++ casts are quite different than C-casts. Understand const_cast, static_cast and dynamic_cast, as well as Real Time Type Identification (RTTI), and the manner in which explicit conversions can be performed using static_cast

Assignment, Pre- and Post-Increment, And Streaming Operators Will Make So Much Sense Now!

Operator overloading is a particularly complicated topic - C++ is virtually alone in the ubiquity of overloaded operators. Make sure this doesn't trip you up.

What is operator overloading? Understand internal operators, defined as member functions of a class vs external operators defined as global functions. External operators are commonly friend functions of the class on which they operate.
Internal or External? When would you choose to have an internal operator implementation vs an external operator implementation? Sometimes you don't have a choice!
The += operator
The assignment operator
Pre- and Post-Increment
Streams and the >> and << operators

Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | March 11, 2016 | ASIN: B01CVJ19E8 | 38 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.19 MB

Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. 

Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! 

While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. 

All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU. 

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces. 

On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful. 

Data Science and Machine Learning

Data science is a trending field in tech and a big part of it is “machine learning”. These are programs that can learn automatically learn what their output should be, instead of trying to manually program it yourself. 

Many startups who are starting to see growth now want to quantify their data and perform analyses that optimize sales, customers, and profit. 

In recent news, Google’s deep learning machine has produced “dream images”. Their machines are so much like the brain, they can produce dreams! In this course, we’re going to cover a technology made by Google just for deep learning, called TensorFlow. We are also going to look at a library that has been around for much longer called Theano. I am going to show you how to build neural networks from scratch using both of these very awesome tools. 

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to take the things you’ve learned, and create very powerful machine learning models to do things like sports betting, stock market prediction, and revenue optimization at your company. 

Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.

Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages By Matthew J. Sottile
2009 | 344 Pages | ISBN: 1420072137 | PDF | 6 MB


Exploring how concurrent programming can be assisted by language-level techniques, Introduction to Concurrency in Programming Languages presents high-level language techniques for dealing with concurrency in a general context. It provides an understanding of programming languages that offer concurrency features as part of the language definition. The book supplies a conceptual framework for different aspects of parallel algorithm design and implementation. It first addresses the limitations of traditional programming techniques and models when dealing with concurrency. The book then explores the current state of the art in concurrent programming and describes high-level language constructs for concurrency. It also discusses the historical evolution of hardware, corresponding high-level techniques that were developed, and the connection to modern systems, such as multicore and manycore processors. The remainder of the text focuses on common high-level programming techniques and their application to a range of algorithms. The authors offer case studies on genetic algorithms, fractal generation, cellular automata, game logic for solving Sudoku puzzles, pipelined algorithms, and more. Illustrating the effect of concurrency on programs written in familiar languages, this text focuses on novel language abstractions that truly bring concurrency into the language and aid analysis and compilation tools in generating efficient, correct programs. It also explains the complexity involved in taking advantage of concurrency with regard to program correctness and performance.

17 <--> Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining
http://nitroflare.com/view/C12CB05C80A55A6/3319257404.pdf


Henning Wachsmuth, "Text Analysis Pipelines: Towards Ad-hoc Large-Scale Text Mining" 
2015 | ISBN-10: 3319257404 | 302 pages | PDF | 19 MB

This monograph proposes a comprehensive and fully automatic approach to designing text analysis pipelines for arbitrary information needs that are optimal in terms of run-time efficiency and that robustly mine relevant information from text of any kind. Based on state-of-the-art techniques from machine learning and other areas of artificial intelligence, novel pipeline construction and execution algorithms are developed and implemented in prototypical software. Formal analyses of the algorithms and extensive empirical experiments underline that the proposed approach represents an essential step towards the ad-hoc use of text mining in web search and big data analytics.
Both web search and big data analytics aim to fulfill peoples’ needs for information in an adhoc manner. The information sought for is often hidden in large amounts of natural language text. Instead of simply returning links to potentially relevant texts, leading search and analytics engines have started to directly mine relevant information from the texts. To this end, they execute text analysis pipelines that may consist of several complex information-extraction and text-classification stages. Due to practical requirements of efficiency and robustness, however, the use of text mining has so far been limited to anticipated information needs that can be fulfilled with rather simple, manually constructed pipelines.

Prior Processes and Their Applications: Nonparametric Bayesian Estimation, Second Edition
Springer | Statistics | August 28, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319327887 | 327 pages | pdf | 3.14 mb

Authors: Phadia, Eswar G.
Presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes
Provides valuable resource for nonparametric Bayesian analysis of big data
Includes a section on machine learning
Shows practical examples

This book presents a systematic and comprehensive treatment of various prior processes that have been developed over the past four decades for dealing with Bayesian approach to solving selected nonparametric inference problems. This revised edition has been substantially expanded to reflect the current interest in this area. After an overview of different prior processes, it examines the now pre-eminent Dirichlet process and its variants including hierarchical processes, then addresses new processes such as dependent Dirichlet, local Dirichlet, time-varying and spatial processes, all of which exploit the countable mixture representation of the Dirichlet process. It subsequently discusses various neutral to right type processes, including gamma and extended gamma, beta and beta-Stacy processes, and then describes the Chinese Restaurant, Indian Buffet and infinite gamma-Poisson processes, which prove to be very useful in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval and featural modeling. Tailfree and Polya tree and their extensions form a separate chapter, while the last two chapters present the Bayesian solutions to certain estimation problems pertaining to the distribution function and its functional based on complete data as well as right censored data. Because of the conjugacy property of some of these processes, most solutions are presented in closed form.
However, the current interest in modeling and treating large-scale and complex data also poses a problem – the posterior distribution, which is essential to Bayesian analysis, is invariably not in a closed form, making it necessary to resort to simulation. Accordingly, the book also introduces several computational procedures, such as the Gibbs sampler, Blocked Gibbs sampler and slice sampling, highlighting essential steps of algorithms while discussing specific models. In addition, it features crucial steps of proofs and derivations, explains the relationships between different processes and provides further clarifications to promote a deeper understanding. Lastly, it includes a comprehensive list of references, equipping readers to explore further on their own.

Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R By Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson
2009 | 449 Pages | ISBN: 1420068725 | PDF | 8 MB


Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.

More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The C++ Standard Library Quick Reference features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms

Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

Dr. Fatih Nayebi, "Swift 3 Functional Programming"
English | ISBN: 1785883887 | 2016 | PDF/EPUB/MOBI | 296 pages | 4 MB/3 MB/4 MB

Bring the power of Swift functional programming to iOS, OS X and Web development to build clean, smart and reliable applications

About This Book
Written for Swift 3, this is a comprehensive guide that introduces iOS and OS X developers to the all-new world of functional programming that has so far been alien to them
Learn about first-class functions and how imperative-style patterns can be converted into functional code using some simple techniques
The book will get you familiar with using functional programming alongside existing OOP techniques so you can get the best of both worlds and develop clean, robust code
Who This Book Is For
The book is for iOS, Web, and macOS developers with a basic knowledge of Swift programming that are interested in learning functional programming paradigms

What You Will Learn
First-class, higher-order, and pure functions
Closures and capturing values
Custom operators, recursion, and memoization
Value and reference types in Swift
Enumerations, algebraic data types, patterns, and pattern matching
Generics and associated type protocols
Higher-order functions such as map, flatMap filter, and reduce
Dealing with optionals, fmap, and apply for multiple functional mapping

Developing an iOS application with FP, OOP, FRP, and POP paradigms

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

With the increasing interest in game development, it's essential to design and implement a UI that reflects the game settings and shows the right information to the player. The Unity system is used to create complex and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces in order to give a professional look and feel to a game. Although the new Unity UI system is powerful and quite easy to use, by integrating it with C# scripts, it's possible to realize the potential of this system and bring an impressive UI to games. This guide is an invaluable collection of recipes if you are planning to use Unity to develop a game. Starting with the basic concepts of the UI components, we'll take you all the way through to creating complex interfaces by including animations and dynamics elements. Based on real-world problems, these recipes will start by showing you how to make common UI elements such as counters and healthbars. You will then get a walkthrough of how to manage time using timers, and will learn how to format them. You will move on to decorating and animating the UI elements to vivify them and give them a professional touch. Furthermore, you will be guided into the 3D UI world and into HUD scripting. Finally, you will discover how to implement complex minimaps in the interface.

Springer | Theoretical Computer Science | Aug 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403397 | 464 pages | pdf | 8.5 mb

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

C# Deconstructed: Discover How C# Works on the .Net Framework By Mohammad Rahman
2014 | 172 Pages | ISBN: 1430266708 | PDF | 5 MB


The basic operational design of a computer system is called its architecture. John von Neumann, a pioneer in computer design, is credited with the architecture of most computers in use today. A typical von Neumann system has three major components: the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor; physical memory; and input/output (I/O). In von Neumann architecture (VNA) machines, such as the 80x86 family, the CPU is where all the computations of any applications take place. An application is simply a combination of machine instructions and data. To be executed by the CPU, an application needs to reside in physical memory. Typically, the application program is written using a mechanism called programming language. To understand how any given programming language works, it is important to know how it interacts with the operating system (OS), software that manages the underlying hardware and that provides services to the application, as well as how the CPU executes applications. In this chapter, you will learn the basic architecture of the CPU (microcode, instruction set) and how it executes instructions, fetching them from memory. You will then learn how memory works, how the OS manages the CPU and memory, and how the OS offers a layer of abstraction to a programming language. Finally, the sections on language evaluation will give you a high-level overview of how C# and common language runtime (CLR) evolved and the reason they are needed.

English | 30 Jun. 2016 | ISBN: 3319294385 | 216 Pages | PDF (True) | 2.84 MB

This text provides a very simple, initial introduction to the complete scientific computing pipeline: models, discretization, algorithms, programming, verification, and visualization. The pedagogical strategy is to use one case study – an ordinary differential equation describing exponential decay processes – to illustrate fundamental concepts in mathematics and computer science. The book is easy to read and only requires a command of one-variable calculus and some very basic knowledge about computer programming. Contrary to similar texts on numerical methods and programming, this text has a much stronger focus on implementation and teaches testing and software engineering in particular.

Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R By Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, Andrew Robinson
2009 | 449 Pages | ISBN: 1420068725 | PDF | 8 MB


Known for its versatility, the free programming language R is widely used for statistical computing and graphics, but is also a fully functional programming language well suited to scientific programming. An Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R teaches the skills needed to perform scientific programming while also introducing stochastic modelling. Stochastic modelling in particular, and mathematical modelling in general, are intimately linked to scientific programming because the numerical techniques of scientific programming enable the practical application of mathematical models to real-world problems. In the last section, stochastic modelling is introduced using extensive case studies on epidemics, inventory management, and plant dispersal. A tried and tested pedagogic approach is employed throughout, with numerous examples, exercises, and a suite of practice projects. Unlike most guides to R, this volume is not about the application of statistical techniques, but rather shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is for those who want to make tools, not just use them.

2016 | ASIN: B01FTJLKYQ | 54 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

Recently, Microsoft’s Twitter bot “Tay” was released into the wild, and quickly began making racist and hateful statements after learning from other Twitter users. The technology behind this? Natural language processing. 

NLP is the use of machine learning algorithms for problems that involve text. 

Do you ever wonder why you get much less spam in your inbox these days compared to 10 years ago? What kinds of algorithms are people using to do spam detection? How can they take words in an email and know how to compute whether or not it’s spam? In this book you are going to build your very own spam detector. 

Did you know people have already used Twitter to determine the current sentiment about a particular company to decide whether or not they should buy or sell stocks? Having a machine that can decide how people feel about something is immensely useful and immediately applicable to revenue optimization. In this course you are going to build your own sentiment analyzer. 

Are you an Internet marketer or are you interested in SEO? Have you ever wanted to know how you can automatically generate content? In this course we are going to take a first crack at building your own article spinner. You’ll learn to write programs that can take an article as input and spit out a similar article with different words as output. This can save you tons of time and thousands of dollars if you’re paying someone to write content for you. 

Natural Language Processing, or as it is often abbreviated, NLP - is the use of programming and math to do language-based tasks. 

If you have Windows or iOS then you have NLP right in front of you! Cortana and Siri are applications that take what you say and turn it into something meaningful that can be done programmatically. 

The key point: NLP is highly practical. NLP is everywhere. 

This book is split up into multiple sections based on the various practical tasks that you can do with NLP: 

Before we do any real programming exercises we’ll look at common NLP tasks (some of these we will actually code ourselves, the others are mentioned so you at least know they exist). We will then look at common data pre-processing techniques used for text. As you’ll see, this preprocessing is what will actually take up a majority of your time when you’re doing NLP. 

The first programming exercise we’ll do is look at how to build a spam detector. Your email inbox uses this, so it’s clearly very useful and it’s been the subject of study for a long time. 

Next we’ll look at “sentiment analysis” and you’ll build your own “sentiment analyzer”. This is how a computer can judge how positive or negative some text is based on the words and phrases that are used. This is also immediately practical - some people have analyzed Twitter feeds to predict whether a stock would go up or down. 

After that we’ll look at the NLTK library. This is a very popular library that solves a lot of fundamental problems in NLP - and you can use it in conjunction with other libraries in your data analysis pipeline. 

Next we’ll look at “latent semantic analysis”. This is basically doing dimensionality reduction on text - and it helps us solve the problem of 2 words having the same meaning. It also helps us interpret our data and save on computation time. 

Lastly, we’ll talk about one of the most popular applications of NLP - article spinning. This is very practical for internet marketers and entrepreneurs. As you know, your search rankings in Google and other search engines are affected negatively when you have duplicate content - so it would be great if you could alter an article you wrote just enough, so that you could put it in 2 different places on the web, without being penalized by Google.

LazyProgrammer, "Convolutional Neural Networks in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Deep Learning in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow" 
2016 | ASIN: B01FQDREOK | 52 pages | EPUB | 1 MB

This is the 3rd part in my Data Science and Machine Learning series on Deep Learning in Python. At this point, you already know a lot about neural networks and deep learning, including not just the basics like backpropagation, but how to improve it using modern techniques like momentum and adaptive learning rates. You've already written deep neural networks in Theano and TensorFlow, and you know how to run code using the GPU. 

This book is all about how to use deep learning for computer vision using convolutional neural networks. These are the state of the art when it comes to image classification and they beat vanilla deep networks at tasks like MNIST. 

In this course we are going to up the ante and look at the StreetView House Number (SVHN) dataset - which uses larger color images at various angles - so things are going to get tougher both computationally and in terms of the difficulty of the classification task. But we will show that convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, are capable of handling the challenge! 

Because convolution is such a central part of this type of neural network, we are going to go in-depth on this topic. It has more applications than you might imagine, such as modeling artificial organs like the pancreas and the heart. I'm going to show you how to build convolutional filters that can be applied to audio, like the echo effect, and I'm going to show you how to build filters for image effects, like the Gaussian blur and edge detection. 

After describing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we will jump straight into code, and I will show you how to extend the deep neural networks we built last time with just a few new functions to turn them into CNNs. We will then test their performance and show how convolutional neural networks written in both Theano and TensorFlow can outperform the accuracy of a plain neural network on the StreetView House Number dataset. 

All the materials used in this book are FREE. You can download and install Python, Numpy, Scipy, Theano, and TensorFlow with pip or easy_install. 

Lastly, my goal is to show you that convolutional networks aren’t magical and they don’t require expert-level math to figure out. 

It’s just the same thing we had with regular neural networks: 

y = softmax( relu(X.dot(W1).dot(W2) ) 

Except we replace the first “dot product” with a convolution: 

y = softmax( relu(conv(X, W1)).dot(W2) ) 

The way they are trained is exactly the same as before, so all your skills with backpropagation, etc. carry over.

In a real-world environment, you can imagine that a robot or an artificial intelligence won’t always have access to the optimal answer, or maybe there isn’t an optimal correct answer. You’d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns. 

Think about the large amounts of data being collected today, by the likes of the NSA, Google, and other organizations. No human could possibly sift through all that data manually. It was reported recently in the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal that the National Security Agency collects so much surveillance data, it is no longer effective. 

Could automated pattern discovery solve this problem? 

Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms? 

Kaggle always seems to provide us with a nice CSV, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys. 

If you haven’t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data! 

A lot of the time this involves manual labor. Sometimes, you don’t have access to the correct information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire. 

You still want to have some idea of the structure of the data. 

This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play. 

In this book we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels. We’ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike. 

The 2 methods of clustering we’ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.

Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, we’ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation, where we talk about how to learn the probability distribution of a set of data. 

One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! We’ll prove how this is the case. 

Lastly, we’ll look at the theory behind principal components analysis or PCA. PCA has many useful applications: visualization, dimensionality reduction, denoising, and de-correlation. You will see how it allows us to take a different perspective on latent variables, which first appear when we talk about k-means clustering and GMMs. 

All the algorithms we’ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that

Beginning Haskell: A Project-Based Approach By Alejandro Serrano Mena
2014 | 300 Pages | ISBN: 1430262508 | EPUB + MOBI | 5 MB + 8 MB


Beginning Haskell provides a broad-based introduction to the Haskell language, its libraries and environment, and to the functional programming paradigm that is fast growing in importance in the software industry. The book takes a project-based approach to learning the language that is unified around the building of a web-based storefront. Excellent coverage is given to the Haskell ecosystem and supporting tools. These include the Cabal build tool for managing projects and modules, the QuickCheck tool for software testing, web frameworks such as Yesud and Snap, and the Persistent and Esqueleto database access libraries. Functional programming is gathering momentum, allowing programmers to express themselves in a more concise way, reducing boilerplate and increasing the safety of code. Indeed, mainstream languages such as C# and Java are adopting features from functional programming, and from languages implementing that paradigm. Haskell is an elegant and noise-free pure functional language with a long history, having a huge number of library contributors and an active community. This makes Haskell the best tool for both learning and applying functional programming, and Beginning Haskell the perfect book to show off the language and what it can do. Beginning Haskell is for programmers new to functional programming, who want to learn this new paradigm and how it can improve the quality of their code. Beginning Haskell is also a great choice for functional programmers wanting to get a taste of the Haskell ecosystem and its unique features, or who wish to learn about advanced functional design patterns.

The Structured Query Language (or SQL) is how we both define and manipulate data within a traditional Relational Database Management System (or RDBMS). In this course, we are going to learn how to structure SQL statements that do just that. Learn how to create databases, manage access, create tables, insert and update data, create indexes and more. We will demonstrate SQL functions and talk about how they differ from the more traditional SQL statements. All of this will be accomplished at a SQL command line within MySQL, but will apply equally to SQL compliant RDBMS systems in general.

Don't waste hours learning SQL concepts you will never use. Pass most technical interviews or get your money back!

I produced the highest rated SQL training video with over 301,000 views and 2800 likes. If you have any doubts, scroll down and read the comments on my SQL videos! Just ranked in the top group of instructors!

This is an SQL course for job seeking beginners or people who are out of practice, that is designed to guarantee that you pass most SQL tech interviews. This is NOT for Database Administrators. This is for trading support applicants or business folks who might need to use the database for research. If you are trying to learn SQL, then my more advanced courses are awesome for that. This class is a very good video cliff note. Nothing more.

I highly recommend this course for people looking for jobs with other (other than SQL) priorities. For example a job that says "Required: FIX Protocol. Plus: SQL". That is the ideal candidate for this course. I'll tell you exactly what the interviewers will be looking for as far as SQL.

I have years working for companies like investment banks and FinTech venders, so I know what software they have and what you need to know. This course gets you right to the information you need faster than anything else. This frees up your time for other pursuits and getting you to that 6 figure job fast!

Don't take MY word for it, take a look at what some of the 301,000 people who have enjoyed my SQL videos have said:

Philipp K. Janert, "Gnuplot in Action: Understanding Data with Graphs"
English | ISBN: 1933988398 | 2009 | EPUB | 396 pages | 5 MB

Statistical data is only as valuable as your ability to analyze, interpret, and present it in a meaningful way. Gnuplot is the most widely used program to plot and visualize data for Unix/Linux systems and it is also popular for Windows and the Mac. It's open-source (as in free!), actively maintained, stable, and mature. It can deal with arbitrarily large data sets and is capable of producing high-quality, publication-ready graphics.

So far, the only comprehensive documentation available about gnuplot is the online reference documentation, which makes it both hard to get started and almost impossible to get a complete overview over all of its features. If you've never tried gnuplot "or have found it tough to get your arms around "read on.

Gnuplot in Action is the first comprehensive introduction to gnuplot "from the basics to the power features and beyond. Besides providing a tutorial on gnuplot itself, it demonstrates how to apply and use gnuplot to extract intelligence from data. Particular attention is paid to tricky or poorly-explained areas. You will learn how to apply gnuplot to actual data analysis problems. This book looks at different types of graphs that can be generated with gnuplot and will discuss when and how to use them to extract actual information from data.

One of gnuplot's main advantages is that it requires no programming skills nor knowledge of advanced mathematical or statistical concepts. Gnuplot in Action assumes you have no previous knowledge of either gnuplot or statistics and data analysis. The books starts out with basic gnuplot concepts, then describes in depth how to get a graph ready for final presentation and to make it look "just right" by including arrows, labels, and other decorations.

Next the book looks at advanced concepts, such as multi-dimensional graphs and false-color plots "powerful features for special purposes. The author also describes advanced applications of gnuplot, such as how to script gnuplot so that it can run unattended as a batch job, and how to call gnuplot from within a CGI script to generate graphics for dynamic websites on demand.

Gnuplot in Action makes gnuplot easy for anyone who needs to do data analysis, but doesn't have an education in analytical tools and methods. It's perfect for DBAs, programmers, and performance engineers; business analysts and MBAs; and Six-Sigma Black Belts, and process engineers.

What's Inside:

Creating graphs with gnuplot
Data transformations and filters
Preparing/polishing graphs for final presentation
Publishing graphs in print or on the Web
Using gnuplot's power features
Gnuplot scripting and programming
Types of graphs and when to use them
Techniques of graphical analysis
How to build, install, and develop for gnuplot
Command and Option reference organized by concept

Very few C++ developers know the time and effort they could save with the algorithm header of the Standard Library. This course unlocks that header by connecting tasks you need to perform to the single line of code from the STL to do them.

If you're a C++ developer, save yourself valuable time and work by learning how to use the algorithm header. In this course, Beautiful C++: STL Algorithms, you'll learn the functions in the algorithm header. You'll find out how iterators multiply the power of the library. Next, you'll learn the conventions that lower your mental burden. Finally, you'll learn how to use the same algorithm with different collections so you don't have to learn new functions. After this course, you'll know what the algorithm header has to offer you and how to use it to your advantage while developing.

Genre: Video Training

Game developers can learn AI Programming using Finite State Machines in Unity using a real time strategy project example. Complex behavior and decision-making is the goal of any good game AI. There are many methods in approaching this, and one of them is using a decision model called a Finite State Machine (FSM).

A state machine is a very useful model in which the possible conditions of an agent are divided into “states”, which can have “transitions” into and out of each other under defined conditions. This is a concept used in many automatic decision-making implementations, including AI programming in games. In fact, Unity’s animation controller uses the state machine concept to model animation behaviors.

In this tutorial we will implement an FSM-based character AI in the context of a point-and-click real-time-tactical combat game in Unity. 

Enemy characters are expected to be on the lookout for the player characters, attack any within sight, pursue any who try to escape, and try to escape combat themselves when their health is below a certain threshold. Within the tutorial an introduction of the Unity project to be worked on is also included.

Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be familiar with C# programming in Unity and the concept of 3D transforms as it is used in the engine. Although the concept of the state machine itself is also introduced in the tutorial, it would also help if you read up on it first.

Also, it should be noted that the game project in this tutorial is controlled using the Unity Remote 4 app, so make sure you have it installed in your device.

Puppet is and has been the de-facto configuration management in Linux and Unix systems. With Puppet 4, it is even bigger and stronger and this course teaches you how to make best use of the Puppet language.

As your server estate grows with more and more virtual systems, so does the difficulty of trying to keep your configurations consistent and reliable. The days of having a few servers to manage are long-gone, and there seems to be an array of different distributions that all require specific tools. Puppet is a mature and respected configuration management tool that is available free of charge as open-source software. In this course, Puppet 4: Language Essentials, you can learn Puppet quickly as the language is written simply with administrators and not developers in mind. First you'll learn how to provide consistent and reliable configuration results, and look at defining configurations as resources. Next, you'll learn to use logic to set the correct service names. Finally you'll be looking at how to restart services after configuration changes. After watching this course, you'll be able to create manifests yourself as well as defining your own configuration needs.

This is the first book to describe the recent significant changes to the Roslyn compiler and demonstrate how .NET developers can use the new Roslyn APIs to create compelling applications.

As an open source compiler, Roslyn now makes its code available for anyone to use. In this book, you’ll get a concise, focused view of this tremendous resource for developers, who can now use any part of the platform implementation to their advantage in analyzing applications, improving code generation, and providing enforceable patterns, all under an OSS model.

You will learn how to analyze your code for defects in a fast, clean manner never available before. You’ll work with solutions and projects to provide automatic refactoring, and you’ll discover how you can generate code dynamically to provide application implementations at runtime

Having the Roslyn compiler API available opens a number of doors for .NET developers that were either simply not there before, or difficult to achieve. However, the API is vast, and this concise book provides a valuable roadmap to this new development environment.

What You Will Learn:
• Understand how to generate, compile, and execute code for a number of scenarios
• How to create diagnostics and refactoring to help developers enforce conventions and design idioms
• Experiment with the compiler code base and see what can be done to influence the inner workings of the compile

This quick reference is a condensed reference guide to the essential data structures, algorithms, and functions provided by the C++ Standard Library. More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The C++ Standard Library Quick Reference features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.

Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.

What You Will Learn

• The essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offer
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms
• What the standard string class provides and how to use it
• What functionality the library provides for file and stream-based I/O
• What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks
• How to write safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the C++11 threading libraries

Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform By Sergei V. Chekanov
2016 | 648 Pages | ISBN: 3319285297 | PDF | 12 MB


Numerical computation, knowledge discovery and statistical data analysis integrated with powerful 2D and 3D graphics for visualization are the key topics of this book. The Python code examples powered by the Java platform can easily be transformed to other programming languages, such as Java, Groovy, Ruby and BeanShell. This book equips the reader with a computational platform which, unlike other statistical programs, is not limited by a single programming language. The author focuses on practical programming aspects and covers a broad range of topics, from basic introduction to the Python language on the Java platform (Jython), to descriptive statistics, symbolic calculations, neural networks, non-linear regression analysis and many other data-mining topics. He discusses how to find regularities in real-world data, how to classify data, and how to process data for knowledge discoveries. The code snippets are so short that they easily fit into single pages. Numeric Computation and Statistical Data Analysis on the Java Platform is a great choice for those who want to learn how statistical data analysis can be done using popular programming languages, who want to integrate data analysis algorithms in full-scale applications, and deploy such calculations on the web pages or computational servers regardless of their operating system. It is an excellent reference for scientific computations to solve real-world problems using a comprehensive stack of open-source Java libraries included in the DataMelt (DMelt) project and will be appreciated by many data-analysis scientists, engineers and students.

James F. Peters, "Computational Proximity: Excursions in the Topology of Digital Images" 
2016 | ISBN-10: 3319302604 | 464 pages | PDF | 26 MB

This book introduces computational proximity (CP) as an algorithmic approach to finding nonempty sets of points that are either close to each other or far apart. Typically in computational proximity, the book starts with some form of proximity space (topological space equipped with a proximity relation) that has an inherent geometry. In CP, two types of near sets are considered, namely, spatially near sets and descriptivelynear sets. It is shown that connectedness, boundedness, mesh nerves, convexity, shapes and shape theory are principal topics in the study of nearness and separation of physical aswell as abstract sets. CP has a hefty visual content. Applications of CP in computer vision, multimedia, brain activity, biology, social networks, and cosmology are included. The book has been derived from the lectures of the author in a graduate course on the topology of digital images taught over the past several years. Many of the students have provided important insights and valuable suggestions. The topics in this monograph introduce many forms of proximities with a computational flavour (especially, what has become known as the strong contact relation), many nuances of topological spaces, and point-free geometry.

In Detail
Functional programming is getting a lot of attention because it eases many of the difficulties faced in object-oriented programming (OOP) such as testability, maintainability, scalability, and concurrency. Swift has a lot of functional programming features that can be easily used, but most Objective-C and Swift programmers are not familiar with these tools.

This book aims at simplifying the functional programming paradigms and makes it easily usable for Swift programmers, by showing you how to use functional programming paradigms to solve many of your day-to-day development problems. Whether you are new to functional programming and Swift, or experienced, this book will strengthen the skills you need to design and develop high-quality, easily maintainable, scalable, extendable, and efficient applications for iOS, Web, macOS, tvOS, and WatchOS.

The book starts with functional programming concepts, the basics of Swift, and essential concepts such as functions, closures, optionals, enumerations, immutability, and generics in detail with coding examples.

Also, this book introduces more advanced topics such as function composition, functional data structures, monads, functors, applicative functors, memoization, lenses, algebraic data types, functional reactive programming (FRP), protocol-oriented programming (POP), and mixing object-oriented programming (OOP) with functional programming (FP) paradigms.

Finally, this book provides a working code example of a real-world frontend application developed with these techniques and its corresponding backend application developed with Swift.

2016 | ISBN-10: 3319304194 | 260 pages | PDF | 4 MB

This book offers a timely report on key theories and applications of soft-computing. Written in honour of Professor Gaspar Mayor on his 70th birthday, it primarily focuses on areas related to his research, including fuzzy binary operators, aggregation functions, multi-distances, and fuzzy consensus/decision models. It also discusses a number of interesting applications such as the implementation of fuzzy mathematical morphology based on Mayor-Torrens t-norms. Importantly, the different chapters, authored by leading experts, present novel results and offer new perspectives on different aspects of Mayor’s research. The book also includes an overview of evolutionary fuzzy systems, a topic that is not one of Mayor’s main areas of interest, and a final chapter written by the Spanish pioneer in fuzzy logic, Professor E. Trillas. Computer and decision scientists, knowledge engineers and mathematicians alike will find here an authoritative overview of key soft-computing concepts and techniques.

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Modelling tasks rarely involve well-defined categories, and they often require multidisciplinary input from mathematics, physics, computer sciences, or engineering. In keeping with this spirit of modelling, the book includes a wealth of cross-references between the chapters and frequently points to the real-world context.
The book combines classical approaches to modelling with novel areas such as soft computing methods, inverse problems, and model uncertainty. Attention is also paid to the interaction between models, data and the use of mathematical software. The reader will find a broad selection of theoretical tools for practicing industrial mathematics, including the analysis of continuum models, probabilistic and discrete phenomena, and asymptotic and sensitivity analysis.

Clojure Reactive Programming By Leonardo Borges
2015 | 232 Pages | ISBN: 1783986662 | EPUB, MOBI, PDF | 15 MB


Reactive Programming (RP) is central to many concurrent systems. It endeavors to make the process of developing highly-concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications simpler and less error-prone. RP comes in many flavors and we will look at some of them in this book. Clojure Reactive Programming is a practical guide aimed at exploring RP. It starts by describing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and its formulations, as well as how it inspired Compositional Event Systems (CES). It also presents several examples of Reactive applications implemented in different frameworks, allowing you to develop an understanding of the subject as well as learn how to develop your ability to work with time-varying values. By the end of the book, you will be equipped to solve real-world problems and have a clear understanding of when and how you should use different the approaches that are shown in the book.

Howard Bowman, Rodolfo Gomez, "Concurrency Theory: Calculi an Automata for Modelling Untimed and Timed Concurrent Systems" 
2005 | pages: 444 | ISBN: 1852338954 | PDF | 7,4 mb

Concurrency Theory is a synthesis of one of the major threads of theoretical computer science research focusing on languages and graphical notations for describing collections of simultaneously evolving components that interact through synchronous communication. The main specification notation focused on in this book is LOTOS. An extensive introduction to this particular process calculus is given, highlighting how the approach differs from competitor techniques, such as CCS and CSP.The book covers linear-time semantics, based on traces; branching-time semantics, using both labeled transition systems and refusals; and true concurrency semantics, using (bundle) event structures. In addition, the book discusses communicating automata approaches (both finite and infinite state); how the theory can be generalised to the timed setting; and, finally the authors generalise the (finite and infinite state) communicating automata notations to yield timed automata and discrete timed automata.This book represents a comprehensive pass through the spectrum of concurrency theory research: From untimed to timed syntax and semantics and process calculi to automata. Researchers and practitioners in the field of concurrency theory, as well as MSc and PhD students, will find the comprehensive coverage in this book essential reading.

Deep Learning in Python Prerequisites: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Linear Regression and Logistic Regression in Python (Machine Learning in Python) by LazyProgrammer
English | March 19, 2016 | ASIN: B01D7GDRQ2 | 43 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 1.31 MB

Do you find deep learning difficult? So you want to learn about deep learning and neural networks, but you don’t have a clue what machine learning even is. This book is for you. 

Perhaps you’ve already tried to read some tutorials about deep learning, and were just left scratching your head because you did not understand any of it. This book is for you. 

Believe the hype. Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google’s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game. 

Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated! 

While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the prerequisites of neural networks, so that learning about neural networks in the future will seem like a natural extension of these topics. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill. 

All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. 

Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don’t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test “kernels” or “interaction effects” - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will eventually let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network is made up of logistic regression units. 

Do you want a gentle introduction to this “dark art”, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you. 

This book was designed to contain all the prerequisite information you need for my next book, Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning with Modern Neural Networks written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow. 

There are many techniques that you should be comfortable with before diving into deep learning. For example, the “backpropagation” algorithm is just gradient descent, which is the same technique that is used to solve logistic regression. 

The error functions and output functions of a neural network are exactly the same as those used in linear regression and logistic regression. The training process is nearly identical. Thus, learning about linear regression and logistic regression before you embark on your deep learning journey will make things much, much simpler for you.

Python Descriptors: A Comprehensive Guide by Jacob Zimmerman

There aren't a ton of really good resources out there for writing Python descriptors, and extremely few books (this may be the only one). This is a sad state of affairs, as it makes it difficult for Python developers to get a really good understanding of how descriptors work and the techniques to avoid the big gotchas associated with working with them.

This book hopes to rectify that situation. Between these covers is a collection of knowledge and ideas from many sources on dealing with and creating descriptors. And, after going through the things all descriptors have in common, it explores ideas that have multiple ways of being implemented as well as completely new ideas never seen elsewhere before.

This truly is a comprehensive guide to creating Python descriptors.

BONUS: A pip installable library, descriptor_tools, was written alongside this book and is an open source library on GitHub at https://github.com/sad2project/descriptor-tools

R Deep Learning Essentials by Dr. Joshua F. Wiley
English | Mar. 30, 2016 | ISBN: 1785280589 | 170 Pages | AZW3/MOBI/EPUB/PDF (conv) | 10.04 MB

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using model architectures. With the superb memory management and the full integration with multi-node big data platforms, the H2O engine has become more and more popular among data scientists in the field of deep learning.

Key Features

Harness the ability to build algorithms for unsupervised data using deep learning concepts with R
Master the common problems faced such as overfitting of data, anomalous datasets, image recognition, and performance tuning while building the models
Build models relating to neural networks, prediction and deep prediction

Book Description

This book will introduce you to the deep learning package H2O with R and help you understand the concepts of deep learning. We will start by setting up important deep learning packages available in R and then move towards building models related to neural networks, prediction, and deep prediction, all of this with the help of real-life examples.

After installing the H2O package, you will learn about prediction algorithms. Moving ahead, concepts such as overfitting data, anomalous data, and deep prediction models are explained. Finally, the book will cover concepts relating to tuning and optimizing models.

What you will learn

Set up the R package H2O to train deep learning models
Understand the core concepts behind deep learning models
Use Autoencoders to identify anomalous data or outliers
Predict or classify data automatically using deep neural networks
Build generalizable models using regularization to avoid overfitting the training data
