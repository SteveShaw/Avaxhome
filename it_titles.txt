Unity UI Cookbook By Francesco Sapio
2015 | 284 Pages | ISBN: 1785885820 | PDF | 18 MB


With the increasing interest in game development, it's essential to design and implement a UI that reflects the game settings and shows the right information to the player. The Unity system is used to create complex and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces in order to give a professional look and feel to a game. Although the new Unity UI system is powerful and quite easy to use, by integrating it with C# scripts, it's possible to realize the potential of this system and bring an impressive UI to games. This guide is an invaluable collection of recipes if you are planning to use Unity to develop a game. Starting with the basic concepts of the UI components, we'll take you all the way through to creating complex interfaces by including animations and dynamics elements. Based on real-world problems, these recipes will start by showing you how to make common UI elements such as counters and healthbars. You will then get a walkthrough of how to manage time using timers, and will learn how to format them. You will move on to decorating and animating the UI elements to vivify them and give them a professional touch. Furthermore, you will be guided into the 3D UI world and into HUD scripting. Finally, you will discover how to implement complex minimaps in the interface.

Linear Algebra for Computational Sciences and Engineering
Springer | Theoretical Computer Science | Aug 16, 2016 | ISBN-10: 3319403397 | 464 pages | pdf | 8.5 mb

Authors: Neri, Ferrante
Covers all aspects of linear algebra from the perspective of computational science and engineering
Provides both a technical approach and an informal interpretation of mathematics
Includes examples with definitions and theorems
Presents a chapter where the study of an electrical network is shown as an algebraic exercise

This book presents the main concepts of linear algebra from the viewpoint of applied scientists such as computer scientists and engineers, without compromising on mathematical rigor. Based on the idea that computational scientists and engineers need, in both research and professional life, an understanding of theoretical concepts of mathematics in order to be able to propose research advances and innovative solutions, every concept is thoroughly introduced and is accompanied by its informal interpretation. Furthermore, most of the theorems included are first rigorously proved and then shown in practice by a numerical example. When appropriate, topics are presented also by means of pseudocodes, thus highlighting the computer implementation of algebraic theory.
It is structured to be accessible to everybody, from students of pure mathematics who are approaching algebra for the first time to researchers and graduate students in applied sciences who need a theoretical manual of algebra to successfully perform their research. Most importantly, this book is designed to be ideal for both theoretical and practical minds and to offer to both alternative and complementary perspectives to study and understand linear algebra.

Realtime destruction systems are a great way to enhance gameplay for many different types of games, and thanks to the performance of modern physics engines and increased power of gaming hardware, these systems are suitable for a wide range of applications. In this course, Authoring Real-time Destruction in Unity 5, you'll create a destruction FX system to simulate a wooden bridge collapse using rigid bodies, physics joints, and particle effects, as well as write some C# code to provide art direction control and allow you to choreograph the destruction sequence. First, you'll add different collider shapes to objects in the scene to determine best approximate fit. Next, you'll learn and understand the reasons for using fixed physics joints and then create one manually to see how they work. Finally, you'll learn about the benefits of particle effects and then create a debris emitter and dust emitter. By the end of this course, you'll be able to create a wide range of destruction systems, from bridges and buildings, to environments and vehicles. Required Software: Unity v5.3.5.

Editors: Pohjolainen, Seppo (Ed.)
Covers the most important classical and modern methods of mathematical modelling
Can be used as textbook or as complimentary material in mathematical modelling courses
Contains 31 project titles as well as 124 problems sets

This book provides a thorough introduction to the challenge of applying mathematics in real-world scenarios. Modelling tasks rarely involve well-defined categories, and they often require multidisciplinary input from mathematics, physics, computer sciences, or engineering. In keeping with this spirit of modelling, the book includes a wealth of cross-references between the chapters and frequently points to the real-world context.
The book combines classical approaches to modelling with novel areas such as soft computing methods, inverse problems, and model uncertainty. Attention is also paid to the interaction between models, data and the use of mathematical software. The reader will find a broad selection of theoretical tools for practicing industrial mathematics, including the analysis of continuum models, probabilistic and discrete phenomena, and asymptotic and sensitivity analysis.

Reactive Programming (RP) is central to many concurrent systems. It endeavors to make the process of developing highly-concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications simpler and less error-prone. RP comes in many flavors and we will look at some of them in this book. Clojure Reactive Programming is a practical guide aimed at exploring RP. It starts by describing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and its formulations, as well as how it inspired Compositional Event Systems (CES). It also presents several examples of Reactive applications implemented in different frameworks, allowing you to develop an understanding of the subject as well as learn how to develop your ability to work with time-varying values. By the end of the book, you will be equipped to solve real-world problems and have a clear understanding of when and how you should use different the approaches that are shown in the book.

Learn to use Python for analyzing data and trade in Stock Markets

There are so many different trading or investing approaches as people in the market.

Many existing tools support the most common ones, but if you really want to success with an innovative practice, you have to build it on your own.

Due to its characteristics, Python is being adopted by the financial industry as its reference programming language.

But Python is not expensive as other financials tools are, in fact it is completely free. And it is not difficult to learn. So, why don't give it a try?

Learn how to apply Python to Trading and Investing with this Hands-on Course.

Ipython Working Environment
Main Data Analysis Python Libraries
How to import/export Financial Data
Data Munging
Customized Charts
Different Projects applying this knowledge
Improve your Programming and Investing Skills at a time.

Either if you can already program and are interested in Finance. Or if you are already a Finance practitioner and are interested in applying programming to your career. This is a course for you.

In addition to using this new knowledge for your own investments, new opportunities will widely open up for you if you are able to combine these two disciplines.

The volume of data is increasing at not seen before rates. And new algorithms and tools are needed to get the most of it. It is difficult to imagine a more promising skill in your career path than learning to manage and analyze data through programming.

Content and Overview

This course will start with a review of main Python libraries to use for Data Analysis.

Although due to the readability of Python it is not necessary to have previous knowledge of it. It is recommended at least to have a previous contact with it.

The main goal is to focus in the application of it to Finance concepts. So not much time will be addressed to common functions or data structures. You will be able, anyway, to send any doubt to the Instructor and if necessary new lectures will be upload replying most frequently asked questions.

The best way to learn is doing. So in the second part of the course, actual applications with the complete code will be developed. You will be able to test and modify them with your desired parameters or strategies and even propose new ones. Building, in this way, a community around the course that will help us to grow up individually.

New projects will be added periodically in the future, but the course price will go up accordingly. So enroll now, It will be your best investment.
