Phone Screen - someone from infrastructure team 1, 

resume 2, Given an application that a class with big data, 

so creating an instance of this class is slow, how to solve it? 

3, Someone implement hash table and it is slow, why? 

4, use hash table to store data, but there is much more data than the machine's RAM, how to deal with that? 

add one more machine, rehash and reconstruct the hash table 

5, A application involves with multiple machines and it is slow, 

figure out why can use matrix to measure the latency and throughput of each machine 

6, process & thread 7, throughput & latency 

On site: （悲剧地没只撑到中午饭 = =） 

1, write a function to determine if a given long num is power of 4 

Using a random number iterator to crate a iterator that only return multiply of 5

2, given a 2 dimension matrix, set all cubes to 1 or 0 according to the number of neighbors' value of 

the cube at the same time (game of life) 

If we have multiple processor, 

how do u improve that If we have multiple machines, how do we apply 

3, Java find bug, multimap implements a map interface and inherits other abstract map

I have a one hour phone screen. 

Interviewer spent 3 minute measures himself and then told me that there will be 6 knowledge questions 

plus one algorithm implementation. 

1. Describe a design pattern (eg factory pattern, MVC)  

2. Describe a hashtable, How does it work? 

3. How to deal with collisions in a hashtable? 

4. Difference between Throughput and Latency   

5. Difference between a process and a thread and difference between their communication  

6. Given a stream of numbers, how would you calculate the median (used 2 heaps, question is on Leetcode)
