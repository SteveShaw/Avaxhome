Alan Holub takes coders deep into the reality of Gang-of-Four design patterns, those reusable guides to common object-oriented design problems. He deconstructs two significant software programs (Mel Conway's "Game of Life" and a SQL interpreter) to demonstrate how design patterns work and interact in complex ways, share classes with other patterns, and have pros and cons. Each of the three primary design pattern categories, creational, structural, and behavioral are discussed and illustrated.

Discover what design patterns are and when they are used in the Agile environment
Exercise better control over object creation using the Factory, Builder, Singleton, Abstract, and Prototype design patterns
Identify easier ways to realize relationships between entities using the Adapter, Decorator, Bridge, Facade, Composite, Flyweight, and Proxy design patterns
Recognize common communication patterns between objects using the Template Method, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator, Observer, Visitor, Mediator, Memento, Strategy, and State design patterns
Examine the Active Object design pattern, an architectural solution to problems inherent in multi-threading
Understand how the strengths and weaknesses of design patterns play off one another
Learn how a given pattern can be implemented in various ways

Alan Holub is one of the world’s top experts in object-oriented design techniques. His clients include Autodesk, Microsoft, Stanford Linear Accelerator, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Genentech, Sybase, and many more. He describes himself as fully buzzword compliant, which is another way of saying that there isn’t a programming language, acronym, or meme existent that he hasn’t used, wrestled with, taught or blogged about during his thirty-six year software development journey.

How To Clean Sunglass Reflections In Photoshop
MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 12M | 234 MB
Genre: eLearning | Language: English

In this lesson I'll teach you how to clean and replace reflections in Photoshop. The idea is to still keep the image realistic. The process will involve creating two new layers, one for each lens of the sunglasses. I then use the pen tool to make a circular selection of each lens. Make sure when you make your selection that the feathering is set to zero. I also save my selection so I can come back if I need to make any changes.

For the next step I need to choose our foreground colour to fill the lens. Using the colour picker, I select a darker colour. I then choose a brown colour for background using the colour picker. Our next step involves using the gradient tool. Make sure your selection is active on the right channel. In the gradient tool I select the first option 'foreground to background.' Holding down shift, we make a vertical selection. To remove the lines created by using the gradient tool, I go to the filter menu and apply some noise. Apply this technique to both lenses (layers).

I then apply a mask after grouping our layers. Remember to switch back to black and white foreground and background colours respectively. Use the brush to paint in the eyes and brush out the polyboard. For the final touch we create another layer and load our selection. Using the gradient tool, a white foreground colour and the selection 'foreground into transparent' I make a small gradient from bottom to top. Adjust the opacity to get the perfect effect. Apply to both selections (lenses).

In Core Java : Advanced LiveLessons, Cay S. Horstmann takes that same approach to introducing experienced programmers to Java, with detailed demonstration. This training pairs with tenth edition of Core Java , Volume II Advanced Features, which has been fully updated to cover Java SE 8.

Introduction 
Lesson 1: Java 8 Interfaces and Lambda Expressions 
Lesson 2: Streams 
Lesson 3: Processing Input and Output 
Lesson 4: Concurrent Programming 
Lesson 5: Annotations 

Not Include:
Lesson 6: Compiling and Scripting 
Lesson 7: Internationalization 
Lesson 8: Date and Time 
Lesson 9: Java Database Connectivity 
Lesson 10: XM 
Summary

In these video LiveLessons, you will learn about advanced Java language features along with the most useful parts of the standard library. In order to take full advantage of the lessons, be sure to download the companion source code. 
Lessons 1 and 2 cover lambda expressions, an important addition to Java 8, and the streams library, which makes extensive use of lambda expressions. With streams, you can efficiently analyze large data sets, simply by telling what you want to achieve. Leave it to the streams library to figure out the “how.”

Lesson 3 covers bread-and-butter issues related to input and output: text processing, file handling, regular expressions, and connecting to web servers.

Lesson 4 covers concurrency, the most important lesson within this LiveLessons training. Nowadays, processors have multiple cores and we need to keep them busy. But it is challenging to write programs that safely run tasks in parallel. This lesson gives you a set of strategies to meet that challenge.

The next two lessons are all about building tools. Lesson 5 introduces the annotation mechanism. You will see how tools use annotations for checking program correctness, generating code, interfacing with databases and web services. Another way of making your programs smarter is by allowing your users to provide extensions in Java or a scripting language. Lesson 6 shows you how to run the Java compiler or a language interpreter in your programs.

In Lesson 7, you will learn how to write programs for users anywhere in the world, with their preferences for formatting and messages in their language. 
Lesson 8 covers the new java.time package that handles complexities like leap years, time zones, and daylight savings time.

The last two lessons, Lessons 9 and 10, show you how to interface with relational databases and how to read and write XML data. These are essential skills for programming server-side application

When should you use Python’s built-in data types, and when should you develop your own? In this video course, George Heineman introduces Python programmers to several important data structures and demonstrates their use with example algorithms. Generic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks can solve many problems, but to work through some specialized problems, you need to learn different ways to structure data appropriately.

Many Python programmers learned their skills through non-traditional routes, rather than through an undergraduate computer science degree. This video helps complete your education in fundamental data types step-by-step. For many of the data structures, you’ll write sample code using a variety of existing modules, and define a process that will help you evaluate and assess these modules for use in your own software. All you need to get started is a working knowledge of Python's built-in data types.

Topics include:

Built-in Python data structures
Python standard library types
Design principles for data structures
Data structures and associated algorithm examples
Graph representations
Heaps, circular buffers, balanced binary trees, and their variants

Genre: Video Training

Java 8 brought many new patterns to build efficient and clean applications. In this course, we cover one most important new thing: lambda expressions. Lambdas are a nice thing, but would be useless without new patterns to process data. These new patterns have been added to the Collection Framework, and to a the new Stream API. This course quickly explains what the map / filter / reduce pattern is about, and why is has been added to the Stream API. This new API is precisely described: how it can be used to efficiently process data and how it can be used in parallel. Caveats and corner cases are also shown.

Learn Python From Scratch! Go from zero programming to building great network apps with Python. Full Python Apps Inside! Do you want to become a Python Developer without having to spend a lot of money on books and boring theoretical courses? Are you a network professional who wants to start automating network tasks? Or maybe you're seeking a raise or even a career change? Join over 1,500 successful students who have decided to learn Python, upgrade their networking skills and boost their careers using this 100% hands-on course!
During this course you will learn Python concepts which are relevant to your networking job and build some amazing tools:

Python App#1: Subnet calculator.
Python App#2: Configuring multiple devices concurrently via SSH and Telnet.
Python App#3: DHCP client simulator for testing a DHCP server.
Python App#4: Collecting information from routers and storing it in a MySQL database.
Python App#5: OSPF network discovery via SNMP. Building the OSPF topology.

Sounds unbelievable given your current programming experience? Well, it's true! How?

First, you will learn and practice every Python key concept, which is explained in one or more video lectures, followed by a short quiz. Each video is filled with relevant examples, in a learn-by-doing fashion and the quizzes will help you consolidate the main ideas behind each Python topic.

After laying the foundation (and also exploring some advanced Python topics), you will dive right into the real-life networking scenarios and apply your knowledge to build 5 great network tools.

"There is no major prerequisite and the material is hand-on from the go. Besides new lectures are being uploaded in response to suggestions and discussions." by Zafar Iqbal

Equipped with working files, network topologies and Python code samples (in .pdf and .py formats), you will be able to work alongside me on each lecture and each application. I will provide a virtual machine with all the Python modules already installed and also the full code for each application, so you can save time and start coding and testing on the spot.

We will use emulated routers in GNS3 to test our Python apps in a network environment, so you can see the actual results of running your code.

I encourage you to learn Python, an amazingly beginner-friendly programming language and take your (networking) job to a higher level of automation.

What are the requirements?

You should have a great desire to learn programming and do it in a hands-on fashion, without having to watch countless lectures filled with slides and theory.
You should already be familiar with networking concepts like: Routing, SSH, Telnet, SNMP.
I will provide a fully configured virtual machine with all the necessary software (Python modules, MySQL, IDE). This way you can save time and start writing code as soon as possible.
I am going to use only free software throughout the course: Python 2.7, Linux, GNS3.
All you need is a decent PC/Laptop (2GHz CPU, 4GB RAM). You will get the rest from me.

Python is a multi-domain, interpreted programming language. It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time being able to use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.

This course follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary. This course uses the simplest programming style, using the fewest lines of code to create a GUI in Python, and then advances to using object-oriented programming in later sections. If you are new to object-oriented programming (OOP), this video course will teach you how to take advantage of the OOP coding style in the context of creating GUIs written in Python.

Throughout this course, you will develop an entire GUI application, building features into it and connecting the GUI to a database. In the later sections, you will explore additional Python GUI frameworks using best practices. You will also learn how to use threading to ensure your GUI doesn't go unresponsive.

The MapReduce programming model is the de facto standard for parallel processing of Big Data. This course introduces MapReduce, explains how data flows through a MapReduce program, and guides you through writing your first MapReduce program in Java.

Processing millions of records requires that you first understand the art of breaking down your tasks into parallel processes. The MapReduce programming model, part of the Hadoop eco-system, gives you a framework to define your solution in terms of parallel tasks, which are then combined to give you the final desired result. In this course, Understanding the MapReduce Programming Model, you'll get an introduction to the MapReduce paradigm. First, you'll learn how it helps you visualize how data flows through the map, partition, shuffle, and sort phases before it gets to the reduce phase and gives you the final result. Next, it will guide you through your very first MapReduce program in Java. Finally, you'll learn to extend the framework Mapper and Reducer classes to plug in your own logic and then run this code on your local machine without using a Hadoop cluster. By the end of this course, you will be able to break big data problems into parallel tasks to help tackle large-scale data munging operations.

cgcookie - Fundamentals of Dynamics
English | mp4 | H264 1920x1080 | AAC 2 ch | 1 hr 55 min | 1.13 GB 
eLearning | Level: Beginner | Software: Blender 2.77

Dynamic Simulation is one of the most “magical” things we can do with Blender. In short, it’s a way to create complex procedural animations that mimic physics.

If you’ve taken a high school math class, you’ll understand that physics calculations require a lot of math. Fortunately, we don’t have to do any math in order to make our models bounce, shatter, splash, and squish – Blender does that math for us! We just give it input materials and Blender does the rest.

In this course we will be taking an introductory look at the nine types of dynamic effects that are available in Blender:

Particles: Dust floating in the air, snow falling from the sky, sparks from a welder, and so much more. This type of effect involves the simulation of large quantities of small bits; i.e. particles.
Hair: Exactly what it sounds like.
Force Fields: Blender objects that mimic real-world forces like gravity, magnetism, vortex, etc.
Rigid Bodies: You know when a Jenga tower falls? It’s like that: The simulation of rigid, non-deforming objects.
Cloth: Also, what it sounds like – The simulation of fabric.
Soft Bodies: In contrast to rigid bodies, this kind of simulation accounts for deformation of objects.
Smoke: The simulation of smoke and fire! Muahaha

Instructor: Rod Stephens

Simple event handlers that do things like make buttons and menu items perform actions, are commonly used by even novice C# programmers. The concept of delegates can seem more complicated and is often avoided by beginners for that reason. However, delegates are working behind the scenes and you are using them without realizing it every time you use events. A better understanding and more control of event handlers will come with a better understanding of delegates. 

In this course, C# wizard Rod Stephens reveals the relationship between delegates and events. He shows you how delegates function, and once that is clear he takes you on a tour of the advanced ways in which you can now work with events. Prerequisites for the course include some C# experience and a computer running Visual Studio 2015.

* Become a better C# programmer by understanding the relationship between delegates and events
* Learn to use delegate types pre-defined by the .NET framework, and define your own delegates
* Discover how to create delegate variables that let you manipulate methods as if they were data
* Learn how to use event handlers in Windows forms and WPF applications
* Understand how to define and raise events, and how to create and use routed events
* Explore tunneling, bubbling, and custom routed events

Microservices is an increasingly popular architecture style that promotes scalability and ease of testing and deployment through small, highly distributed service components. It may sound like the correct architecture for your situation, but if you're new to microservices, how do you really know? Understanding microservices' pitfalls (practices that are never a good idea) and anti-patterns (practices that seem like a good idea, but aren't) is a good place to start. 

In this video, 20+ year software architecture veteran Mark Richards (IBM, CSC, etc.) doesn't just identify the pitfalls and anti-patterns of microservices, he shows you how to avoid them. You'll learn about service granularity estimation, database migration, microservices reporting, distributed transaction management, remote access latency, contract versioning, distributed logging, and much more.

* Understand how to recognize and avoid costly microservices development mistakes
* Survey each of the 10 most common pitfalls associated with microservices
* Get wise to the 6 hidden anti-patterns that can ruin a microservices effort
* Master the knowledge required to stay clear of these pitfalls and anti-patterns

A text mining system must go way beyond indexing and search to appear truly intelligent. First, it should understand language beyond keyword matching. For example, it should be able to distinguish the critical difference between "Jane has the flu" and "Jane had the flu when she was 9". Second, it should be capable of making likely inferences even if they're not explicitly written. 

For example, inferring that Jane may have the flu if she has had a fever, headache, fatigue, and runny nose for three days. And third, it should do its work as part of a robust, scalable, efficient and easy to extend system. This course teaches software engineers and data scientists how to build intelligent natural language understanding (NLU) based text mining systems at scale using Java, Scala and Spark for distributed processing.

* Learn the meaning of natural language understanding (NLU) and its use in text mining

* Discover how to build a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline within a big data framework

* Recognize the differences between NLP pipelines and other approaches to semantic text mining

* Learn about standard UIMA annotators, custom annotators, and machine learned annotators

* Discover how different types of annotators are composed into a text processing pipeline

* Use machine learning to generate annotators and apply them within a data pipeline

* See pipeline architectures that incorporate Kafka, Spark, SparkSQL, Cassandra, and ElasticSearch

A case study for transforming data structures or dashboards into reporting layouts in 5 steps

The aim of this course is to give you a combination of knowledge about basic and advanced functions and functionalities provided by Microsoft Excel, while guiding you in creating a dashboard and/or advanced data structures step by step from the beginning till the very end. 

When I started learning Excel, I realized that it is very 
important to know Excel functions, but knowing them is not enough. You 
have to build it into your daily work and start thinking the way Excel 
"thinks". 

I would like to give you a case study, where starting from the beginning we are building a dashboard together while explaining all the necessary steps to do so. My goal is to show you how to create an interactive, automated, easy to use data structure for reporting purposes by using basic and advanced functions, moreover, designing and advanced controlling elements. 

With this course I will focus on a real-life example I had
to face during my work and try to shed light on what Excel is capable 
of. The structure of the course touches the basics as well, so that if
you do not have a strong basis, it still gives you guidance and a firm 
fund to continues and handle more complex data structures and dashboards. My aim is to show you how the functions work and then give you some tips how to use them in creating data structures. 
Although this case study covers one specific problem and its solution, I would encourage you to use all the skills you can learn from it, as dozens of similar structures can be created on the basis of the curriculum you find in this course.

Learn best practices of software design to provide flexible and reusable software solution

Subtitles are available for Introduction, Case Study and Design Patterns Concepts.

Design and architecture of any software/solution provides the base and makes it flexible, extensible for future requirements. A good designed software/solution makes it easy to understand and maintain. Design patterns are known as best practices to design software for problems which are repeated in nature.

This course "Design Patterns Through C++" gives you understanding of all 23 patterns described in Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

Each pattern is explained in a simple way with intent, problem, solution and structure. Also the information of participants, collaboration, consequences and implementation are explained for each one. The pattern structure or example implementation of C++ source are explained to understand how it will be implemented in Object Oriented language C++.

The course also provides C++ source code of each pattern to understand it in better way. This helps in applying the variation on implementation to see how it can resolve some other implementation bottleneck. There are quizzes after Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns to check your understanding.

This course will help to understand the best practices for design and apply them to do the better design of software/solution in C++.

Diagnosing application performance problems on a PC can feel like you have to be one part detective and one part psychic. Your application may compile and run fine—until boom, it crashes. These crashes are usually caused by memory leaks: poorly managed resource allocations in the application. Luckily, with Windows Performance Toolkit, you can locate and correct problems such as memory leaks quickly and efficiently. Thomas Pantels, former application engineer at Intel, shows how to analyze and optimize applications with memory leaks using Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). He drills into an OpenCV application developed in C++, walks through the source code, and fixes the leak, providing a thorough overview of Windows Performance Toolkit in action and practical techniques that will help your applications make better use of system resources.

The Manual Labor of Zen Meditation
.MP4, AVC, 5000 kbps, 1920x1080 | English, AAC, 192 kbps, 2 Ch | 1 hour | 2.6 GB
Instructor: Gordon Greene

a course for beginners who like to use their bodies for learning meditation

People often start meditating out of a need to connect the world in their head with the reality around them. One way to do that is through use of your senses. This course focuses on a way in which you can use a deeply visceral sense of your breath and the sensation of gravity throughout your body to do the work of meditation.

Feel Your Meditation Come Alive as Your Use of Breath and Gravity Comes Alive

Many traditions teach that your meditation deepens as the length of your exhalations deepen.

Lengthening exhalations comes out of exploration of the connection between your breathing and the ways in which every part of your body experiences gravity.

One way to explore that connection is through practice with a sword.

Another way is to split firewood with a splitting maul.

When done properly both of those practices strongly reinforce the use of breath and gravity when doing Zen meditation.

The work of Zen meditation is to resolve duality – the simplest duality to begin working on is the mind and body duality.

Zen Meditation is Manual Labor

This course began when I met a young Swedish tech entrepreneur last November. He is self-taught in almost all things that interest him. This openness is what led him to Spring Green Dojo, a curiosity to see what he might learn about using his whole body to engage the world instead of just his thoughts.

He spent three days training with us in Zen, with the focus of that training being the physical ways in which we deepen our use of breath. Given the short amount of time to work together, I wanted him to viscerally grasp the two core principles that guide Zen training: the work is to resolve duality, and your body and your senses are your tools to do that. So we trained with a sword and then did Zen meditation. We trained with a splitting maul and then did Zen meditation. With a sword and a maul, the movements are big and obvious. When sitting on a meditation cushion, the movements are far more subtle.

Overview of the Course

This course takes you through the same steps that this young Swede experienced. First, understand that the work of Zen training is physical. Then, find how using a sword and a splitting maul can teach how use of breath and gravity lie at the heart of that work. And finally, take that learning to the meditation cushion. You'll find sixteen lectures, taking up a total of just under 70 minutes.

The Cracking the Coding Interview Videos are unscripted videos showing you what happens in a real technical interview. Watch Gayle L. McDowell, the founder and CEO of CareerCup, interview a candidate, just like she did over 100 times for big companies like Google and Microsoft. Watch how candidates face a new problem, dissect it, and code it on the white board.

What do we mean by "unscripted?"

Exactly what it sounds like. The candidates were not told what to say when, or how to solve the question. They didn't even know what they would be asked until the cameras were rolling! In other words, what you are watching is 100% true-to-life.
These videos will:
Expose you to what a real Google / Microsoft / Amazon interview is like.
Show you how to handle questions when you don't know the answer.
Show you, via mid-video pop-ups, what is going well and what the interviewer is thinking about.
Teach you what Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for in an interview.

The Full Interview Video is a video that shows you what an interview is like, from start to end. The contents include:
- Overview of what companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for.
- Discussion of the candidate's resume, to show you how to discuss your resume and what you're likely to be asked.
- Two coding and algorithms questions (including white-boarding coding). This candidate didn't know the answers, so you can learn how to handle this situation.
Great For: General / Resume Questions. Algorithms and Whiteboard Coding. Understanding what a real interview is like.

Genre: Video Training

A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up.

It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application.

In the Movement in an RPG Game course, you learned how to move a player in a 2D tile-based map. Here you'll program, trigger, and manage random battles on the map. Author Jesse Freeman shows how to create pop-up battle windows, add monsters, and create player and monster attack actions—including evasive maneuvers. When the battle is over, you'll learn to reward the player and clean up for future moves.

Data scientists who use Excel realize that R is emerging as the new standard for statistical wrangling (especially for larger data sets). This course serves as the perfect bridge for the many Excel-reliant data analysts and business users who need to update their data science skills by learning R. Much of the course focuses on how crucial statistical tasks and operations are done in R—often with the DescTools package—as contrasted with Excel's functions and Data Analysis add-in, and then scales up from there, showing R's more powerful features. Conrad Carlberg will help you effectively toggle between both programs, moving data back and forth so you can get the best of both worlds. Start by learning how to install R and the DescTools package, and the data files used in all the hands-on exercises. Then learn about calculating descriptive statistics on numeric and nominal variables, and running bivariate analyses in both Excel and R. In the "Next steps" video, Conrad breaks down the pros and cons of Excel vs. R and provides tips for learning more about statistics in each application.

Distributed systems and multi-core platforms are far too prevalent now to dismiss everyday concurrency. This course outlines several concurrency patterns that the Java Concurrency API simplifies, making it much easier to scale your Java application.

There are several gems inside the existing concurrency API that have been hiding in the background for years, waiting to be discovered by curious software engineers. The existing Java Concurrency API makes it much easier to build a Java application that is scalable and performant without having to settle for lots of low-level wait-notify usage or lots of locking using the synchronized keyword. In this course, Scaling Java Applications Through Concurrency, you'll cover several concurrency patterns simplified by the Java Concurrency API; these patterns will make scaling new and existing Java applications simpler than ever. First, you'll learn about how the Java Concurrency API has changed scalability and how to run processes in the background. Next, you'll cover classes that will help you avoid mistakes like lost updates when sharing resources. Finally, you'll discover how to coordinate dependent processes and implementing throttling. By the end of this course, you will be able to easily scale your Java applications through concurrency so that they work better and faster.
