McDowell, the founder and CEO of CareerCup, interview a candidate, just like she did over 100 times for big companies like Google and Microsoft. Watch how candidates face a new problem, dissect it, and code it on the white board.

What do we mean by "unscripted?"

Exactly what it sounds like. The candidates were not told what to say when, or how to solve the question. They didn't even know what they would be asked until the cameras were rolling! In other words, what you are watching is 100% true-to-life.
These videos will:
Expose you to what a real Google / Microsoft / Amazon interview is like.
Show you how to handle questions when you don't know the answer.
Show you, via mid-video pop-ups, what is going well and what the interviewer is thinking about.
Teach you what Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for in an interview.

The Full Interview Video is a video that shows you what an interview is like, from start to end. The contents include:
- Overview of what companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for.
- Discussion of the candidate's resume, to show you how to discuss your resume and what you're likely to be asked.
- Two coding and algorithms questions (including white-boarding coding). This candidate didn't know the answers, so you can learn how to handle this situation.
Great For: General / Resume Questions. Algorithms and Whiteboard Coding. Understanding what a real interview is like.

Genre: Video Training

A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up.

It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application.

When it comes to writing asynchronous code in JavaScript, callbacks can be a hassle. In this course, you'll see alternatives to callbacks, including ES6 promises, and how to combine generators with promises to write async code in a synchronous style.

In this course, Modern Asynchronous JavaScript, you will learn how to write asynchronous code that's a joy to maintain, not a burden. You will learn how to reason about promises, an alternative to callbacks, by creating a promise framework. Seeing promises from the perspective of a producer helps reason better about being the consumer of promise based APIs. Then, you will learn about ES6 generators and how to combine them with promises to write code that looks synchronous but that's actually asynchronous. This style cuts out the inherent verbosity of callbacks and even promises alone. When you're finished with this course, you'll know how to write asynchronous code in a fashion that's not a hassle to maintain.

Data scientists who use Excel realize that R is emerging as the new standard for statistical wrangling (especially for larger data sets). This course serves as the perfect bridge for the many Excel-reliant data analysts and business users who need to update their data science skills by learning R. Much of the course focuses on how crucial statistical tasks and operations are done in R—often with the DescTools package—as contrasted with Excel's functions and Data Analysis add-in, and then scales up from there, showing R's more powerful features. Conrad Carlberg will help you effectively toggle between both programs, moving data back and forth so you can get the best of both worlds. Start by learning how to install R and the DescTools package, and the data files used in all the hands-on exercises. Then learn about calculating descriptive statistics on numeric and nominal variables, and running bivariate analyses in both Excel and R. In the "Next steps" video, Conrad breaks down the pros and cons of Excel vs. R and provides tips for learning more about statistics in each application.

Distributed systems and multi-core platforms are far too prevalent now to dismiss everyday concurrency. This course outlines several concurrency patterns that the Java Concurrency API simplifies, making it much easier to scale your Java application.

There are several gems inside the existing concurrency API that have been hiding in the background for years, waiting to be discovered by curious software engineers. The existing Java Concurrency API makes it much easier to build a Java application that is scalable and performant without having to settle for lots of low-level wait-notify usage or lots of locking using the synchronized keyword. In this course, Scaling Java Applications Through Concurrency, you'll cover several concurrency patterns simplified by the Java Concurrency API; these patterns will make scaling new and existing Java applications simpler than ever. First, you'll learn about how the Java Concurrency API has changed scalability and how to run processes in the background. Next, you'll cover classes that will help you avoid mistakes like lost updates when sharing resources. Finally, you'll discover how to coordinate dependent processes and implementing throttling. By the end of this course, you will be able to easily scale your Java applications through concurrency so that they work better and faster.
