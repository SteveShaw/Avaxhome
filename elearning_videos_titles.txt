cgcookie - Fundamentals of Dynamics
English | mp4 | H264 1920x1080 | AAC 2 ch | 1 hr 55 min | 1.13 GB 
eLearning | Level: Beginner | Software: Blender 2.77

Dynamic Simulation is one of the most “magical” things we can do with Blender. In short, it’s a way to create complex procedural animations that mimic physics.

If you’ve taken a high school math class, you’ll understand that physics calculations require a lot of math. Fortunately, we don’t have to do any math in order to make our models bounce, shatter, splash, and squish – Blender does that math for us! We just give it input materials and Blender does the rest.

In this course we will be taking an introductory look at the nine types of dynamic effects that are available in Blender:

Particles: Dust floating in the air, snow falling from the sky, sparks from a welder, and so much more. This type of effect involves the simulation of large quantities of small bits; i.e. particles.
Hair: Exactly what it sounds like.
Force Fields: Blender objects that mimic real-world forces like gravity, magnetism, vortex, etc.
Rigid Bodies: You know when a Jenga tower falls? It’s like that: The simulation of rigid, non-deforming objects.
Cloth: Also, what it sounds like – The simulation of fabric.
Soft Bodies: In contrast to rigid bodies, this kind of simulation accounts for deformation of objects.
Smoke: The simulation of smoke and fire! Muahaha
Fluid: Liquid simulation like a pipe gushing water for example.
Dynamic Paint: Think of this like writing with your finger on a foggy mirror. This is an interesting simulation genre that interprets object-to-object interaction into surface information like vertex weights.

Instructor: Rod Stephens

Simple event handlers that do things like make buttons and menu items perform actions, are commonly used by even novice C# programmers. The concept of delegates can seem more complicated and is often avoided by beginners for that reason. However, delegates are working behind the scenes and you are using them without realizing it every time you use events. A better understanding and more control of event handlers will come with a better understanding of delegates. 

In this course, C# wizard Rod Stephens reveals the relationship between delegates and events. He shows you how delegates function, and once that is clear he takes you on a tour of the advanced ways in which you can now work with events. Prerequisites for the course include some C# experience and a computer running Visual Studio 2015.

* Become a better C# programmer by understanding the relationship between delegates and events
* Learn to use delegate types pre-defined by the .NET framework, and define your own delegates
* Discover how to create delegate variables that let you manipulate methods as if they were data
* Learn how to use event handlers in Windows forms and WPF applications
* Understand how to define and raise events, and how to create and use routed events
* Explore tunneling, bubbling, and custom routed events

A text mining system must go way beyond indexing and search to appear truly intelligent. First, it should understand language beyond keyword matching. For example, it should be able to distinguish the critical difference between "Jane has the flu" and "Jane had the flu when she was 9". Second, it should be capable of making likely inferences even if they're not explicitly written. 

For example, inferring that Jane may have the flu if she has had a fever, headache, fatigue, and runny nose for three days. And third, it should do its work as part of a robust, scalable, efficient and easy to extend system. This course teaches software engineers and data scientists how to build intelligent natural language understanding (NLU) based text mining systems at scale using Java, Scala and Spark for distributed processing.

* Learn the meaning of natural language understanding (NLU) and its use in text mining

* Discover how to build a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline within a big data framework

* Recognize the differences between NLP pipelines and other approaches to semantic text mining

* Learn about standard UIMA annotators, custom annotators, and machine learned annotators

* Discover how different types of annotators are composed into a text processing pipeline

* Use machine learning to generate annotators and apply them within a data pipeline

* See pipeline architectures that incorporate Kafka, Spark, SparkSQL, Cassandra, and ElasticSearch

Django is one of the world's leading web development platforms. This Python web framework makes your app building experience smoother, faster, and easier. It is a key feature behind the success of many start-ups across the world, including Instagram and Nextdoor. This course introduces next-level advanced concepts to help you build your own professional-grade Django applications. Author Kevin Veroneau starts off by explaining how class-based views—a powerful, but often poorly understood feature—work in Django. Then learn how to create custom middleware to help organize frequently used code. Have you ever wanted to build a complete RESTful API? Find out how to do just that, starting with a basic read-only API and then adding key-based authentication to allow the full range of CRUD functionality. Plus, discover how to use model managers and the Q method to make it easier to get the data we need to our views and clients. For the finishing touches, dive into the details of caching to improve application performance, and then add custom management commands to help automate routine tasks. Note: Mastering Django Web Development was created by Packt Publishing. We are pleased to host this training in our library.

A case study for transforming data structures or dashboards into reporting layouts in 5 steps

The aim of this course is to give you a combination of knowledge about basic and advanced functions and functionalities provided by Microsoft Excel, while guiding you in creating a dashboard and/or advanced data structures step by step from the beginning till the very end. 

When I started learning Excel, I realized that it is very 
important to know Excel functions, but knowing them is not enough. You 
have to build it into your daily work and start thinking the way Excel 
"thinks". 

I would like to give you a case study, where starting from the beginning we are building a dashboard together while explaining all the necessary steps to do so. My goal is to show you how to create an interactive, automated, easy to use data structure for reporting purposes by using basic and advanced functions, moreover, designing and advanced controlling elements. 

With this course I will focus on a real-life example I had
to face during my work and try to shed light on what Excel is capable 
of. The structure of the course touches the basics as well, so that if
you do not have a strong basis, it still gives you guidance and a firm 
fund to continues and handle more complex data structures and dashboards. My aim is to show you how the functions work and then give you some tips how to use them in creating data structures. 
Although this case study covers one specific problem and its solution, I would encourage you to use all the skills you can learn from it, as dozens of similar structures can be created on the basis of the curriculum you find in this course.

Design and architecture of any software/solution provides the base and makes it flexible, extensible for future requirements. A good designed software/solution makes it easy to understand and maintain. Design patterns are known as best practices to design software for problems which are repeated in nature.

This course "Design Patterns Through C++" gives you understanding of all 23 patterns described in Gang Of Four book - "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

Each pattern is explained in a simple way with intent, problem, solution and structure. Also the information of participants, collaboration, consequences and implementation are explained for each one. The pattern structure or example implementation of C++ source are explained to understand how it will be implemented in Object Oriented language C++.

The course also provides C++ source code of each pattern to understand it in better way. This helps in applying the variation on implementation to see how it can resolve some other implementation bottleneck. There are quizzes after Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns to check your understanding.

This course will help to understand the best practices for design and apply them to do the better design of software/solution in C++.

The Manual Labor of Zen Meditation
.MP4, AVC, 5000 kbps, 1920x1080 | English, AAC, 192 kbps, 2 Ch | 1 hour | 2.6 GB
Instructor: Gordon Greene

a course for beginners who like to use their bodies for learning meditation

People often start meditating out of a need to connect the world in their head with the reality around them. One way to do that is through use of your senses. This course focuses on a way in which you can use a deeply visceral sense of your breath and the sensation of gravity throughout your body to do the work of meditation.

Feel Your Meditation Come Alive as Your Use of Breath and Gravity Comes Alive

Many traditions teach that your meditation deepens as the length of your exhalations deepen.

Lengthening exhalations comes out of exploration of the connection between your breathing and the ways in which every part of your body experiences gravity.

One way to explore that connection is through practice with a sword.

Another way is to split firewood with a splitting maul.

When done properly both of those practices strongly reinforce the use of breath and gravity when doing Zen meditation.

The work of Zen meditation is to resolve duality – the simplest duality to begin working on is the mind and body duality.

Zen Meditation is Manual Labor

This course began when I met a young Swedish tech entrepreneur last November. He is self-taught in almost all things that interest him. This openness is what led him to Spring Green Dojo, a curiosity to see what he might learn about using his whole body to engage the world instead of just his thoughts.

He spent three days training with us in Zen, with the focus of that training being the physical ways in which we deepen our use of breath. Given the short amount of time to work together, I wanted him to viscerally grasp the two core principles that guide Zen training: the work is to resolve duality, and your body and your senses are your tools to do that. So we trained with a sword and then did Zen meditation. We trained with a splitting maul and then did Zen meditation. With a sword and a maul, the movements are big and obvious. When sitting on a meditation cushion, the movements are far more subtle.

Overview of the Course

This course takes you through the same steps that this young Swede experienced. First, understand that the work of Zen training is physical. Then, find how using a sword and a splitting maul can teach how use of breath and gravity lie at the heart of that work. And finally, take that learning to the meditation cushion. You'll find sixteen lectures, taking up a total of just under 70 minutes.

This course will help you understand how the class-based component abstraction presented by Windows Runtime language projections is actually implemented in terms of traditional COM interfaces. You will learn all about the tools and compilers that are necessary to build rich components entirely with Standard C++ in the most efficient manner. You will discover how abstractions like constructors and static methods are implemented with activation factories. You will learn how delegates and events are actually implemented with COM interfaces and lock-free algorithms. And you will discover the weird and wonderful way that the Windows Runtime uses C++ templates to simulate CLR generics using parameterized interfaces.

The Cracking the Coding Interview Videos are unscripted videos showing you what happens in a real technical interview. Watch Gayle L. McDowell, the founder and CEO of CareerCup, interview a candidate, just like she did over 100 times for big companies like Google and Microsoft. Watch how candidates face a new problem, dissect it, and code it on the white board.

What do we mean by "unscripted?"

Exactly what it sounds like. The candidates were not told what to say when, or how to solve the question. They didn't even know what they would be asked until the cameras were rolling! In other words, what you are watching is 100% true-to-life.
These videos will:
Expose you to what a real Google / Microsoft / Amazon interview is like.
Show you how to handle questions when you don't know the answer.
Show you, via mid-video pop-ups, what is going well and what the interviewer is thinking about.
Teach you what Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for in an interview.

The Full Interview Video is a video that shows you what an interview is like, from start to end. The contents include:
- Overview of what companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon look for.
- Discussion of the candidate's resume, to show you how to discuss your resume and what you're likely to be asked.
- Two coding and algorithms questions (including white-boarding coding). This candidate didn't know the answers, so you can learn how to handle this situation.
Great For: General / Resume Questions. Algorithms and Whiteboard Coding. Understanding what a real interview is like.

Genre: Video Training

A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up.

It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application.

When it comes to writing asynchronous code in JavaScript, callbacks can be a hassle. In this course, you'll see alternatives to callbacks, including ES6 promises, and how to combine generators with promises to write async code in a synchronous style.

In this course, Modern Asynchronous JavaScript, you will learn how to write asynchronous code that's a joy to maintain, not a burden. You will learn how to reason about promises, an alternative to callbacks, by creating a promise framework. Seeing promises from the perspective of a producer helps reason better about being the consumer of promise based APIs. Then, you will learn about ES6 generators and how to combine them with promises to write code that looks synchronous but that's actually asynchronous. This style cuts out the inherent verbosity of callbacks and even promises alone. When you're finished with this course, you'll know how to write asynchronous code in a fashion that's not a hassle to maintain.

Data scientists who use Excel realize that R is emerging as the new standard for statistical wrangling (especially for larger data sets). This course serves as the perfect bridge for the many Excel-reliant data analysts and business users who need to update their data science skills by learning R. Much of the course focuses on how crucial statistical tasks and operations are done in R—often with the DescTools package—as contrasted with Excel's functions and Data Analysis add-in, and then scales up from there, showing R's more powerful features. Conrad Carlberg will help you effectively toggle between both programs, moving data back and forth so you can get the best of both worlds. Start by learning how to install R and the DescTools package, and the data files used in all the hands-on exercises. Then learn about calculating descriptive statistics on numeric and nominal variables, and running bivariate analyses in both Excel and R. In the "Next steps" video, Conrad breaks down the pros and cons of Excel vs. R and provides tips for learning more about statistics in each application.

Distributed systems and multi-core platforms are far too prevalent now to dismiss everyday concurrency. This course outlines several concurrency patterns that the Java Concurrency API simplifies, making it much easier to scale your Java application.

There are several gems inside the existing concurrency API that have been hiding in the background for years, waiting to be discovered by curious software engineers. The existing Java Concurrency API makes it much easier to build a Java application that is scalable and performant without having to settle for lots of low-level wait-notify usage or lots of locking using the synchronized keyword. In this course, Scaling Java Applications Through Concurrency, you'll cover several concurrency patterns simplified by the Java Concurrency API; these patterns will make scaling new and existing Java applications simpler than ever. First, you'll learn about how the Java Concurrency API has changed scalability and how to run processes in the background. Next, you'll cover classes that will help you avoid mistakes like lost updates when sharing resources. Finally, you'll discover how to coordinate dependent processes and implementing throttling. By the end of this course, you will be able to easily scale your Java applications through concurrency so that they work better and faster.

Learn to play violin from zero to playing simple tunes in a few simple steps - suitable for all ages

This course teaches students the first steps in learning how to play the violin. So if you've just got a new violin and don't know where to start it's the perfect beginners course for you.

The course videos last less than an hour but you can expect to have to practice each individual lesson repeatedly to get good results. Everybody learns at a different pace so it's important that you just work through the course steadily at you own individual speed.

The course starts right at the beginning and teaches you hold to hold the violin and bow. How to identify the different parts of the violin. How to tune the strings correctly. How to position the bow on the strings and make simple bowing movements. Then a 3 finger pattern is demonstrated so that you can play different notes correctly. Finally all the newly learned techniques are combined and you will be taught how to play three simple traditional tunes.

There's no fluff in this course and technical jargon and music theory has been kept to a minimum, I have concentrated on teaching good practical techniques and tried to make them as enjoyable and fun to learn as I can.

I believe that everyone has the ability to learn an instrument if they have the right mental attitude and are prepared to put a bit of work in. So if you if you fancy learning the violin join me now and I'll have you playing a simple tune in a matter of a few hours!.
